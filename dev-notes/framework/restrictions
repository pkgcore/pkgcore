# general info/commentary on restrictions.  see layout.txt for historical background.

general protocol is simple,

def match(self, pkginst) 

is all that's expected.  pkginst being an instance like pkgcore.ebuild.ebuild_package.
all base restrictions chunks should support the negate option, usually via something akin to this in match
return boolean-value-for-this-match ^ self.negate

Individual restrictions are built up via pkgcore.restrictions.restriction .  Str matches, package data matches, etc,
are covered by that module.  More likely then not, people will need to be able to bind restrictions together via boolean ops;
these 'sets' of restrictions (they're technically sequences) are in pkgcore.restrictions.restrictionSet.

AndRestrictionSet # boolean and
OrRestrictionSet	# boolean or
XorRestrictionSet	# boolean xor

The sequences above support negate also (unless it makes no sense whatsoever, negation (effectively 'not restrict.match(blah)'), 
should be supported.

If you need another base boolean op, *please* generalize it in restrictionSet so that everyone can share the wealth. :)

Keep an eye on not creating 101 different restriction types.  If possible, build up from basic chunks.

Why?  For a remote repository implementation, it *will* have to translate the restrictions into it's own internal querying format 
fex, an atom, AndRestrictionSet(pkg cat attribute strexact, pkg name attribute strexact, pkg ver attribute versmatch), 
=dev-util/diffball-0.6.5,  for an rdbms backend would be *best* to translate into sql, 
essentially `WHERE (category="dev-util" AND package="diffball" and version="0.6.5")`.

If a lego like approach is used (eg, small blocks, building up more complex blocks from the original bases) translation of the 
bases *should* make conversion from restriction elements to internal format *much* easier, mainly attainable.

Aside from that, keep an eye on the restriction implementations; be aware that there may be *lots* of them.  As of the time of this writing,
$PORTDIR/profiles/package.mask comes out to around 938 seperate restricts, with 353 boolean ands (1291 total).
Use __slots__ for the classes, or consider implementing a flywheel design, point is, keep them as small as possible, with a careful
eye on execution.

Example: a simple error involving an extra set of unnecssary function calls in the restrict base, once corrected, accounted for a 150x
reduction in run time on p.mask filtering of a repository (3.4s to 0.022s).  Effectivelly, you're defining chunks of executable code 
thrown around to do verification, as such, keep in mind they'll be ran a *lot*.
Profile the suckers, iow.

Beyond that, restrict base classes probably are candidates for conversion to cpython, although experimenting with that should come down
the line (prototype and get it running first, then see if you can shave 5-10% off from the conversion).


Combining restrictions: (containment tests, ya ya)


force_{False,True}:
replacement of cmatch design/concept; effectively, when operating in this matching mode, changes *are* pushed onto 
the package, actively attempting to force a match (rather then just indicating if it matches or not, as match does).

Beware the boolean ops; a force_Fail and has N^2 -1 potential returns, which should all be iterated over (or possible to do so at least).
