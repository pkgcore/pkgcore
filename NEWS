Pkgcore Release Notes
=====================

See ChangeLog for full commit logs; this is summarized/major changes.

pkgcore 0.2.1:

* fix corner case for portage configuration support; old system (<=2004)
  installations may have /etc/portage/sets/world, which confused pmerges
  world updating, leading to writing bad entries.  Ticket 54.

* fix issues with distcc/ccache (ticket 55) so that they actually work.


pkgcore 0.2:

* glsa pkgset will now include metadata/glsa from overlays.

* pmaint script; tool for --sync'ing, doing quickpkging, moving packages
  between repos for repository conversions. General repository maintenance.

* sync subsystem: supports bzr, cvs, darcs, git, mercurial (hg), rsync,
  and subversion.

* binpkg repositories now support modification; FEATURES=buildpkg basically

* binpkg contents handling is significantly faster.

* pmerge: 
  * supports --ask (thanks to nesl247/alex heck)
  * pmerge --replace is default now; use --noreplace for original behaviour.
  * 'installed' set was added; is a pkgset comprised of all slotted atoms from
    the vdb; useful for pmerge -u to enable upgrades of *everything* installed.
  * versioned-installed set was added; useful for -e, this set is compromised
    of exact version of everything installed.
  * added --with-built-depends, -B; resolver defaults to ignoring 'built'
    ebuild depends (those from vdb, from binpkgs for example), this option
    tells it to update those depends.

* xterm titles

* massive resolver cleanup, and general fixes.

* rewritten plugins system, register_plugins is no longer used.
  
* paludis flat_list cache read/write support.

* portage flat_list cache write support (cache used for
  $PORTDIR/metadata/sync)
  
* pebuild/pregen/pclone_cache: heavy UI cleanup.
 
* pquery:
  * prettier printing of depends/rdepends/post_rdepends under -v
  * print revdep reasons
  * now requires an arg always; previously defaulted to '*', which is 
    still supported but also accessible via --all .
  * added --maintainers-email and --maintainers-name; use case insensitive 
    regex by default for --maintainer style options.

* added repo_id atom extension; see doc/extended-atom-syntax.rst for details.
  short version, sys-apps/portage::gentoo would match portage *only* from 
  ``gentoo`` repository.

* overlays now combine mirror targets from their parent repository, and
  from their own repository data.

* configuration subsystem:
  * configuration: lazy section refs were added (lazy_ref), useful for when
    the object arguement needs to be instantiated rarely (syncers for
    repositories for example).

  * mke2fs (literal /etc/mke2fs.conf file) akin configuration format was
    added, pkgcore.config.mke2fsformat.config_from_file .

* expanded test coverage.
  
* merged standalone test runner into setup.py; prefered way of running it is
  ``python setup.py test`` now.

* ongoing portage configuration support additions- 
  * FEATURES=collision-protect support
  * INSTALL_MASK support, FEATURES noinfo, nodoc, and noman support.
  * /etc/portage/package.* files can be directories holding seperate files
    to collapse

* gnu info regeneration trigger added.

* performance improvements:
  * cpython extensions of select os.path.* functionality; 20x boost for what
    was converted over (stdlib's posix module is a bit inefficient).
  
  * cpython extension for file io in pkgcore.util.osutils: 7x faster on ENOENT
    cases, 4x-5x on actual reading of small files (think cache files).  If
    iterating over lines of a file, use pkgcore.util.osutils.readlines- again,
    faster then standard file object's equivalent- 3x reduction (7.6ms to 2.5ms
    for full contents  reading).

  * partial cpython reimplementation of atom code; mainly parsing, and
    critical __getattr__ invocation (2+x faster parse).
  
  * partial cpython reimplementation of depset code; strictly just parsing.
    Faster (given), but mainly is able to do optimizations to the depset
    cheaply that python side is heavily slowed down by- ( x ( y ) ) becomes
    ( x y ) for example.

  * chunks of restriction objects were pushed to cpython for memory reasons,
    and bringing the instantiation cost down as low as possible (the common
    restrict objects now are around 1-3us for new instantation, .5 to 1us
    for getting a cached obj instead of instantiating).

  * bug corrected in base repo classes identify_candidates method; should now 
    force a full walk of the repo only when absolutely required.

  * chksuming now does a single walk over a file for all checksummers,
    instead of one walk per checksummer- less disk thrashing, better
    performance.

  * vdb virtuals caching; massive performance boost via reduced IO.  Relies on
    mtime checks of vdb pkg directories for staleness detection, 
    auto-regenerating itself as needed.

* heavy profile code cleanup; should only read each common profile node once
  now when loading up multiple profiles (pcheck).  Far easier code to read 
  in addition.

* cache eclass staleness verification now relies on mtime comparison only- 
  allows for eclasses to move between repos; matches portage behaviour.

* pkgcore.util.caching.*, via __force_caching__ class attr in consumers, can 
  be used to force singleton instance creation/caching (error if unhashable).

* ebuild support:
  * PORTAGE_ACTUAL_DISTDIR was reenabled, thus cvs/svn equivalent ebuilds are 
    usable once again.
  * fixed pkgcore's pkgcore emulation of has_version/best_version matching 
    behaviour for old style virtuals to match portages (oddity, but ebuilds 
    rely on the goofy behaviour).
  * various fixups to unpack function; should match portage behaviour as of 
    01/07 now.
  * if FEATURES=test, set USE=test; if USE=test has been explicitly masked for
    a package, disable src_test run; matches portage 2.1.2 behaviour.
  * cleanup build directory, and unmerge directories upon finishing

* filter-env now is accessible directly via python; pkgcore.ebuild.filter_env .
  Needs further work prior to being usable for pcheck inspection of ebuilds, 
  but it's a good start.


pkgcore 0.1.4:

* Compatibility with caches written by portage 2.1.2_pre3-r8.


pkgcore 0.1.3:

* Always process "|| ( a b )" in the right order.

  * Fix disabling a flag in package.use.mask or package.use.force.


pkgcore 0.1.2:

* Make filter_env work on hppa (and possibly more architectures) where using
  python CFLAGS for this standalone binary does not work.

* Fall back to plain text output if the TERM variable is unsupported.

* Deal with dangling symlinks in binpkg repositories.

* Fix expanding of incrementals (like USE) in make.defaults.

* pquery: support --attr fetchables, handle extra commandline arguments as
  -m or --expr restrictions.

* USE deps once again allow setting a flag only if it is actually settable
  on the target package.


pkgcore 0.1.1:

* hang fix for test_filter_env
  
* package.keywords fixes: no longer incremental, supports '*' and '~*'
  properly
  
* FEATURES="userpriv" support works again.
  
* pmerge repository ordering now behaves properly; prefers src ebuilds, then
  built pkgs; -k inverts that (previously was semi-undefined)
  
* binpkg fixes: run setup phase
  
* replace op fixes: force seperate WORKDIR for unmerge to protect against 
  env collisions
  
* loosened category rules: allow _. chars to support cross-dev hack.
  
* build fixes: make $A unique to avoid duplicate unpacks; force distdir
  creation regardless of whether or not the pkg has any stated SRC_URI
  (fixes cvs and subversion eclsas usage).  Fix sandbox execution to chdir
  to an existant directory (sandbox will fail if ran from a nonexistant dir).
  
* change DelayedInstantiation objects to track __class__ themselves; this 
  fixes pquery to properly shutdown when ctrl+c'd (previously could swallow
  the interrupt due to cpython isinstance swallowing KeyboardInterrupt).
  
  
pkgcore 0.1: 

Initial release.
  
* Sync functionality doesn't yet exist (pmaint script will be in 0.2)
  
* pmerge vdb modification requires --force; this will be disabled in 0.2, 
  mainly is in place so that folks who are just looking, don't inadvertantly
  trigger an actual modification.
  
* not all portage FEATURES are implemented; same for QA.
  
* If overlays are in use, pkgcore may defer to its' seperate cache to avoid 
  pkgcore causing cache regen for portage (and vice versa); this occurs due
  to pkgcore treating overlays as their own repo and combining them at a 
  higher level; portage smushes them all together thus rendering each subtree
  unusable in any standalone fashion.

* pkgcore is far more anal about blocking bad behaviour in ebuilds during
  metadata regeneration; tree is clean, but if you do something wrong in 
  global scope, it *will* catch it and block it.
  
* EBD; daemonized ebuild.sh processing (effectively), pkgcore reuses old
  ebuild.sh processes to avoid bash startup, speeding regen up by roughly
  2x.
