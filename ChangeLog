  MAJOR CHANGES in 2.0.51:
    1. /var/cache/edb/virtuals is no longer used at all. It's calculated now.
    2. /var/cache/edb/world is now /var/lib/portage/world.
    3. /etc/portage/profile/virtuals is _USER_ configs only.

  15 Aug 2005; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py:
  Fix logic error with sandbox.

  bin/ebuild-functions.sh: merging spankys original changes (which I stupidly stomped)
  forward.

  11 Aug 2005; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> pym/elog_modules/mod_mail.py:
  Fixed missing portage_exception import and type errors in the exception
  handler.

  10 Aug 2005; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> bin/quickpkg:
  Call gawk instead of awk so non-GNU systems work #102050 by Stephen Bennett.

  Add support for unpacking rar archives.

  29 Jul 2005; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> bin/prepallman:
  Rather than use a hardcoded list and bash expansion, let find locate man
  directories for us.  This fixes the issues of running prepman on symlinks 
  to paths outside of $D #98017 by Andrej Filipcic.

  29 Jul 2005; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> bin/fowners bin/fperms:

  25 Jul 2005; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> 
  bin/ebuild-default-functions.sh:
  Fix IMAGE / D confusion in the pkg_preinst function.  Now ebuilds do not
  have to care/screw around with IMAGE.

  20 Jul 2005; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild*.{sh,lib}:
  Harring broke cvs.  If people ignored the warnings, I'll fix it till the 
  next time changes in rewrite cause it to break again.

  04 Jul 2005; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>
  bin/ebuild-default-functions.sh:

  13 Jun 2005; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild.sh:
  Use the %p output modifier instead of %F so we don't have to update the
  output by removing all the $D references.

  06 Jun 2005; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/dispatch-conf
  pym/dispatch_conf.py: Brought forward updates in stable.

  bin/ebuild-default-functions.sh:
  Allow src_install() to abort if scanelf locates questionable binaries and 
  user has 'stricter' in their FEATURES.

  23 May 2005; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> 
  bin/ebuild-default-functions.sh:

  python side to bash.

  05 May 2005; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/test_target_graph.py
  pym/portage_dep.py: Added some basic utility methods to StateGraph. Reworked

  Add FEATURES=strict.

  25 Apr 2005; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild-functions.sh:
  Remove autoconfig FEATURE and make it always run Bug #81822.

  25 Apr 2005; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py:
  remove the stupid "masked by -* keyword" message.

  24 Apr 2005; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> pym/portage_syntax.py:
  Added a class called DependSpec which handles parsing *DEPEND and SRC_URI
  strings. Read-only at the moment, but will probably change later.

  24 Apr 2005; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/emerge pym/portage.py:
  Removed support for --inject and --upgradeonly as well as the now unused
  digraph class.

  23 Apr 2005; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> pym/ebuild.py:
  forward port fix for bug 77794.

  19 Apr 2005; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> bin/etc-update:
  Clean up some silly `cat` usages and make the output format pretty.

  12 Apr 2005; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> bin/quickpkg pym/ebuild.py 
  pym/portage.py:
  Rename 'portage-pkg' to 'binpkgs' so tab completion for 'portage' works.

  08 Apr 2005; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/emerge:
  Add a list of active user config files to emerge --info.
  
  06 Apr 2005; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> pym/set_modules/*.py:
  Added a basic framework for package sets including modules for "system",
  general filelists (including "world") and "security", the latter currently
  depending on glsa.py from gentoolkit.

  03 Apr 2005; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> pym/portage_dep.py:
  Added shortcut to circular dep "resolution" as per bug 85130. Removed
  the traversed cache dict from __traverse_nodes and made the original
  list into a dict.

  27 Mar 2005; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild-functions.sh:
  Pushed ECONF_SOURCE support forward from stable.  Seems kind of fluffish.

  23 Mar 2005; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/dispatch-conf:
  Removed the -a argument from all diff usage.

  21 Mar 2005; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> pym/portage_const.py:
  Adding prerm and postrm to EBUILD_PHASES so logging works there too.
  
  21 Mar 2005; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild-functions.sh:
  Force the copy by removing the destination first in econf/autoconfig,
  prevents sandbox violations by libtoolize calls without --copy.

  15 Mar 2005; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/cache/*;
  Cache updates moving _eclasses_ handling up into the template layer, 
  added delayed sync'ing support (see database.autocommit) which is relevant 
  for rdbms backends.

  13 Mar 2005; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage_dep.py:
  Addded a traversed cache dict to __traversed per call, the slowdown was 
  pointed out by Thomas de Grenier de Latour (TGL).  56s, to ~6s.  Probably 
  should be using a dict for traversed, but is dependant on whether the returned
  list is order, or can be random.

  10 Mar 2005; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py:
  fix breakage wrt portage_const.EBUILD_PHASES

  09 Mar 2005; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/emerge:
  emerge --metadata can now be ran by non-root users.

  09 Mar 2005: Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/ebuild.py, bin/emerge:
  Don't set 02775 on depcache_dir.
  Ever.
  If the cache backend is stupid and can't get the perms right, fix the backend.

  09 Mar 2005; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/cache/fs_template.py:
  _ensure_dirs didn't account for umask.

  09 Mar 2005; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/cache/flat_list.py:
  Damn I'm cool- _eclasses_ are now properly returned.

  09 Mar 2005; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py, pym/ebuild.py:
  Two issues- use parsed restrict handling, and depends phase not bailing when
  a cpv's key's can't be sourced

  09 Mar 2005; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> pym/elog_modules/mod_mail.py:
  Add a "To" header to mails.

  09 Mar 2005; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild-daemon.sh:
  portageq shouldn't prefix its output as it's used in variables.

  08 Mar 2005; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/ebuild.py: Revert part of 
  the restrict/portage_restrict changes so use conditionals in restrict work
  again.

  08 Mar 2005; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py, pym/portage_dep.py,
  pym/portage_util.py, pym/config.py:  Moved match_from_list, match_to_* stuff
  into portage_dep, and updated references, and fixed a few bugs related to 
  match_* locations from last check in.
  Threw out match_from_list_original func- it's dead code.

  08 Mar 2005; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: Harring's law 
  in effect- stupid one line bugs do not rear their head till the delta hits the 
  repository... :/
  Fix for the INHERITED auto-determination in portdbapi.aux_get

  08 Mar 2005; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py, bin/emerge, 
  cache/*, pym/eclass_cache.py :  Cache refactoring.  Eclass_cache is now just 
  a dict of stacked eclasses, but doesn't track per pkg eclasses.
  That is left up to the cache.  The cache now ignores/drops INHERITED- this 
  is replaced by _eclasses_, which is a serialized dict of 
  {eclass name: (on disk location, long(mtime))}.  Note the tuple- returns from the 
  cache subsystem *should* be tuples, just the same as mtime should be a long.
  aux_get *should* return INHERITED, but it should do it dynamically.
  Basically, INHERITED is determined on the fly from the cache's _eclasses_ setting.
  Beyond that, a sql cache template was added, along with a sqlite example.
  flat_list, along with a metadata/cache specific backend, and cache.util.mirror_cache, 
  for metadata transfers.
  Note all existing cache modules/implementations are now invalidated.  Sorry.  Upgrade em.
  Existing cache's on disk are invalidated also, with the exemption of portdir/metadata/cache.
  Old cache classes have been banished to the attic.

  08 Mar 2005; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py, pym/ebuild.py:
  Fixing fetch restriction code. Replace references to PORTAGE_RESTRICT with 
  just RESTRICT and fix broken writemsg() calls.

  08 Mar 2005; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py:
  Reverting broken patch for fakedbapi.cp_all(): it returned a nested list 
  instead of a simple list and was weird at best.

  06 Mar 2005; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> autogen.sh:
  used for autogenerating auto* crap after a checkout.

  06 Mar 2005; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/emerge, pym/portage_dep.py, 
  pym/portage_file.py, pym/portage_util.py, pym/portage.py, pym/config.py, 
  pym/eclass_cache:
  Broke config class out into it's own module.  Minimal hacks, 3 from portage
  imports that can't be gutted till reliance on global db is gone.  Aside 
  from that, shifts of funcs around.
  Also broke eclass_cache out.

  06 Mar 2005; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/emerge: Added a check
  to make sure the file exists before working with it, when called with an
  ebuild path. #84102  Fixed the invalid call to isvalidatom() #84144
  Expanded syslist during the unmerge phase so that all packages listed in
  system are correctly checked and warned against.  #83670

  02 Mar 2005; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: Fixed a
  var substitution that caused installed virtuals to not be considered.

  02 Mar 2005; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/ebuild.py: added a 
  check to force PORTAGE_LOGFILE to have the appropriate owner/perms.

  02 Mar 2005; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> pym/portage_util.py: Added
  missing bsd_chflags import required after forward porting.

  02 Mar 2005; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: Added -* to
  FEATURES before saving back to the env after modification.

  27 Feb 2005; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/emerge pym/ebuild.py:
  Fixed a couple of syntax errors.

  26 Feb 2005; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> src/chflags/*: Added
  spb's bsd chflags support.

  26 Feb 2005; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> cnf/*: Brought forward
  changes from portage_2_0.

  26 Feb 2005; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> pym/*: Brought forward
  changes from portage_2_0.

  26 Feb 2005; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/*: Brought forward
  changes from portage_2_0. Repoman is broken until pym/* is updated.

  25 Feb 2005; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: 
  yanked PORTAGE_TMPFS support, no longer relevant since data is fed 
  back via daemon pipes, not via file on disk.

  24 Feb 2005; <solar@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild-default-functions.sh:
  - added manifest_files to USER_CONFIG_PATH+/manifest_excludes. The way it
  works is to add a file to /etc/portage/manifest_files and this file will be
  ignore when checking the Manifest. This is mainly only useful when you
  rsync_exclude a file thats list in the Manifest. (embedded)

  21 Feb 2005; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/isolated-functions.sh,
  cnf/make.conf, cnf/make.conf.alpha, cnf/make.conf.amd64,
  cnf/make.conf.arm, cnf/make.conf.hppa, cnf/make.conf.ia64,
  cnf/make.conf.mips, cnf/make.conf.ppc, cnf/make.conf.ppc64,
  cnf/make.conf.s390, cnf/make.conf.sh, cnf/make.conf.sparc,
  cnf/make.conf.x86, pym/ebuild.py, pym/portage.py, pym/portage_const.py,
  +pym/elog_modules/__init__.py, +pym/elog_modules/mod_custom.py,
  +pym/elog_modules/mod_mail.py, +pym/elog_modules/mod_save.py,
  +pym/elog_modules/mod_syslog.py:
  New shiny flexible modular logging system. Supports logging of ebuild
  messages via syslog, mail and storing on disc with an optional command for
  post-processing. See make.conf on how to configure it. On the technical side
  it's one of the first pluggable subsystems, you can just put mod_foo in
  /usr/lib/portage/pym/elog_modules, set PORTAGE_LOG_SYSTEM=foo and all logs
  are processed by your new module (see existing modules for the very simple
  API).

  17 Feb 2005; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py, 
  pym/portage_db_flat.py: Collection of speedups, some massive. 
  J?rgen H?tzel <gentoo@hoetzel.info> deserves massive props for identifying
  a huge slow down in cp_all.  Aside from that, pushed the locking 
  rewrite for flat_list forward from stable, and cleaned up aux_get and
  eclass.is_valid.

  06 Jan 2005; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/emerge:
  Fixing some calls to pkgsplit to not modify the returned tuple.

  29 Dec 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/emerge: Sort the unmerge
  to make the --pretend output easier to review when there is a large list.
  Fixed depclean's attempt at modifying a tuple returned from pkgsplit.

  28 Dec 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> man/Makefile.am:
  Removed eclass man pages from makefile references.

  15 Dec 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org>
  bin/ebuild-default-functions.sh:
  Disabling the warning for GID=portage as it affects most/all packages and
  gets really annoying.

  14 Dec 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/emerge pym/portage.py:
  Fixed emerge so that the "emerge by path" message is only shown when the
  "path" ends in .ebuild or .tbz2. Fixed the package.keywords bug that caused
  all packages to become unmasked.

  11 Dec 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> pym/portage_syntax.py:
  Modified atom.match() to reflect the change of cpv becoming an attribute of
  atom.

  10 Dec 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: Fixed a bug
  due to the cleanup patch where zfill() was being called on an integer.

  09 Dec 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild-functions.sh:
  Fixing stupid typo that broke einstall for CONF_LIBDIR archs.

  09 Dec 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org>
  bin/ebuild-default-functions.sh:
  Changing LDFLAGS to CFLAGS for the setXid check.

  08 Dec 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py:
  Changing CWD back to the original value broke verify-rdepend, fixing it with
  the same code as used for collision-protect. Also made the time displays in
  treewalk more readable.

  08 Dec 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> portage_syntax.py: Inital
  commit. Refactors all of portage_versions.py and some functions from
  portage.py into a CPV class and an Atom class.

  08 Dec 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> ebuild-default-functions.sh
  emerge portageq portage.py portage_dep.py portage_exec.py portage_util.py
  portage_versions.py: Added Ludal's clean up patch. #69523

  05 Dec 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> tarball.sh: Yanked
  the script- A) it's specific to nicks setup, B) the tarball/release 
  creation functionality is already handled by the autotooling of portage
  (make dist), C) make dist does it better, and automatically handles
  pulling in all required deps as an ancillary function of it's building/installing,
  D) make dist requires no specific maintenance while tarball.sh does.

  05 Dec 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/cache, pym/cache/template.py,
  pym/cache/fs_template.py, pym/cache/sql_template.py, pym/cache/flat_list.py, 
  pym/cache/anydbm.py, pym/cache/sqlite.py, pym/cache/cache_errors.py, 
  pym/cache/__init__.py:  Cache refactoring, not active in the code currently.
  All backends should work, although the code is not finished.  Locking support
  needs to be added into fs_template- possibly do it in the derived fsbased 
  backeends, since locking for flat_list is quite different from locking for 
  anydbm.

  05 Dec 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: swegener
  made quite a find in portdbapi.cpv_exists, the comparison on the tuple
  returned by findname2 always evaluated true.

  05 Dec 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> bin/: Added SpanKY's
  patch for stripping coherency -- All stripping is performed in prepstrip.

  28 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild-daemon.sh: 
  Correction of return code for execute_phases w/ logging.

  26 Nov 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/emerge: Fixed a bug in
  graph_display.use_flags().

  24 Nov 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/emerge: Fixed a bug in
  the relevant package calculation for dep display.

  24 Nov 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/emerge: Added the removal
  of fully installed dependency subtrees causing faster calculation due to less
  circular dependencies.

  23 Nov 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/emerge: --columns
  support is in and working. Algorithm has changed a little so that the minimum
  space is used while keeping 2 spaces between all columns.

  23 Nov 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/emerge: Added class
  graph_display and moved most of depgraph.display() into various functions
  of it. --columns and --resume are not yet supported with it, so the
  depgraph.display() has been kept for the time being.

  23 Nov 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: Commented
  the deprecation notice for /etc/portage/virtuals as it does not yet have
  a newer counterpart.

  22 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/transports/fetchcommand.py:
  spawn_bash, not spawn.

  22 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> src/filter-env/posix.c:
  Anchor generated regex filters, fix to the damned looping over stdin still.

  22 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> src/filter-env/posix.c:
  Final bugs should be shaken out of the pipe reading now.
  realloc and I don't get along.

  22 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild-functions.sh:
  econf now ignores update_confcache's exit_code, and uses configure's.  Should
  kill off the occasionaly "couldn't update confcache" and killing of compile phase.

  22 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> src/filter-env/posix.c:
  Commited what should be a fix for the "lets randomly drop part of the env"
  issue that's been around lately.   Basically, it looks like it wasn't reading
  all of what was dumped to stdin.  Converted it to fread/fopen based, and used
  feof.  General cleanup aside from that, close fd's on the way out, etc.

  20 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild.sh:
  filter-env is now in use.  In other words, you *will* have to do 
  the configure/install to get the binary, since it *is* required for
  correct env processing.  I tried a host of other solutions, so far 
  I can't break this one (aside from dumb typos in the code).  Processing 
  the envs from kdelibs/arts is now possible again.

  20 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage_const.py:
  Added compatibility hack due to sandbox being moved.  Will remove it once 
  people have shifted over to using the split out sandbox's new location.

  20 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> <collection-of-files>:
  Portage is now autotool'd, w/ relevant configure.  Needs work, specifically,
  cnf installation isn't there yet- would prefer to add that when the 101 arch 
  specific make.conf's are collapsed down to one file.  Note sandbox was busted 
  out, and moved into it's own module.

  18 Nov 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> pym/portage_versions.py:
  Fixing version regexp to allow weird package names.

  15 Nov 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild-default-functions.sh:
  NEVER try to change permissions on symlinks, stupid chmod will change the
  referenced files instead (fixed the portage uid/gid checks in dyn_install)

  15 Nov 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py, portage_gpg.py:
  Fixes for the gso changes in gpg. Removed the 'virtuals' file handling
  which caused an empty file to be recreated. Added XXX marks on potentially
  bad calls.

  14 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> spec/emerge.syntax:
  Bye bye emerge.syntax, we hardly knew ye.

  14 Nov 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/emerge, man/make.conf.5,
  spec/emerge.syntax, cnf/make.conf.*, cnf/make.globals*:
  removing all support for AUTOCLEAN=no, it's breaking too many things these
  days and has no real use anyway.

  10 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/dcache.py:
  Updated to make it more memory efficient- slots based, uses weakref
  to handle symlink'd dirs.  Still a bit slower, but it's also stat'ing
  all directories upto the target directory.  That can probably be removed.
  Note, there is a bug in it currently- invalidate isn't a valid node method.
  Nobody should hit this though, since dcache is only used in treewalk.
  I'll correct it in a few days.

  10 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage_locks.py:
  Reversion of lock choice strategy to what I stuck in originally, and 
  removal of the 3s sleep in hardlink.  The 3s is obviously bad, the 
  reason for reverting to trying flock then lockf then hardlink is simple-
  hardlink is slow, and requires creation of extra files on disk.  It
  also won't behave with fd's passed in (which should be used often, 
  rather then this lets default to creating lots of files strategy.  This makes 
  a huge difference in runtime in certain cases.  Case that exposed this- 
  9m relying on lockf -> hardlink reduced to 1.5m for flock -> lockf -> 
  hardlink.  The difference?  lockf didn't work on that fs, so it was using
  hardlink.  Leave it in, it's faster, it's redundant, and it works.

  10 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py,
  pym/portage_versions.py: Moved catsplit into versions and updated
  references to it.  Likely just broke a few external tools (assuming
  they were coded correctly and weren't abusing string.split("/")).

  10 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> 
  bin/ebuild-default-functions.sh, bin/affect-fakeroot-perms.sh:
  Closing out bug where suid/sgid is wiped by chowning,
  noticed a similar issue in affect-fakeroot-perms. (#56129)

  10 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild.sh:
  Dropping all support for reloading env attributes from a .51 dump.
  It wasn't implemented correctly, and it's not worth the duct tape
  and questionable code to try and half-ass support it.

  10 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/etc-update:
  Fixed etc-update so it actually runs; long story short, the portageq
  calls for getting CONFIG_PROTECT(|_MASK) were wrong.

  10 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild.sh:
  Added kludge to filtering for env reloading to match the export kludge
  added to 2.0.51.  This code must stay in as long as .51 env's 
  *potentially* exist on a users system.

  10 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild-daemon.sh:
  Made it much more noisy when a violation is hit.

  10 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> 
  bin/affect-fakeroot-perms.sh:  rewrote this script so that it's less 
  likely to piss off fakeroot by spawning multiple instances of a client.

  10 Nov 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> +pym/portage_versions.py,
  bin/db-update.py, bin/emerge, bin/fixvirtuals, bin/pkgname, bin/repoman,
  pym/ebuild.py, pym/portage.py, pym/portage_dep.py:
  Integrated the new version parsing and comparison code from bug #37406, moved
  pkgsplit, catpkgsplit, pkgcmp, vercmp and ververify in portage_versions.py
  and changed all calls to them. The new code allows for more flexible 
  version strings, some functions probably still have to be fixed to work
  with those new extensions.

  09 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/dcache.py, 
  pym/orig_dict_cache.py, portage.py:  Removed listdir optional arg
  EmptyOnError- wasn't abided by for non-recursive calls, for recursive calls
  it only returned None when recursing.  Optional arg wasn't used, so it's gone.
  Moved followSymlink logic into listdir, so that orig_dict_cache is strictly
  a caching mechanism.  Added dcache, a symlink aware list based cache class.
  dcache needs work, but reduces listdir($IMAGE_OF_XORG,recursive=1) from 
  spending hours to return (on my machine), to around a minute.
  Made dcache active *only* for treewalk currently, since that's the 
  instance where the original cache implementation's lack of symlink-awareness
  made things bad.

  09 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/ebuild.py: make
  prelink + confcache play nice (calc_prelink=1).

  09 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild-daemon.sh:
  Added appropriate addwrites for logs for -r3 sandbox, and corrected logging
  for bash v2 systems.

  09 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: Corrected
  som idiocy I introduced into listdir.

  09 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: buggy logic
  in listdir w/ ignorecvs on. (#70170)

  08 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: tweaked
  portage.exit_callbacks so it's more flexible.  
  Call portage.append_exit_callback to append to it, optionally specifying args
  and keyword args.

  08 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portageq.py, bin/portageq:
  Tied portageq script into using the portageq module.

  07 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/repoman: converted repoman
  over to using the users preferred fetcher (via portage.get_preferred_fetcher,
  oddly enough).

  07 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/transports/fetchcommmand.py:
  corrected an issue where it wasn't correctly parsing out an appropriate distdir
  when file_name was specified.

  07 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild-default-functions.sh: 
  addition of INSTALL_MASK support to dyn_preinst.   #67190

  07 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage_db_flat.py: added a
  mtime cache to revert the the # of stats to 1 for aux_get calls (which calls 
  get_timestamp).

  07 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage_exec.py, sync/rsync.py:
  Bug fixes for selinux.setexec typo, and noisy rsync.  Aside from that, a collection
  of header updates.

  07 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage_util.py,pym/portage.py:
  tweak to make movefile not implode, and get_preferred_fetcher not implode.

  07 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage_metadata.py, 
  pym/orig_dict_cache.py, pym/portage.py, pym/portage_util.py: Added missing 
  metadata module (contributed via solar iirc), and corrected circular dependency
  issue regarding portage_util trying to provide backwards compatability via
  portage_util.normpath.

  07 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/ebuild.py: forgot to commit this
  in the last commit.  Kind of required. :)

  07 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py, bin/emerge, 
  bin/env-update, bin/repoman, cnf/make.conf, pym/ebuild.py, bin/affect-fakeroot-perms.sh:  Merge of the 
  ebuild-daemon code (ebuild.py), along with massive shifts/cleanup/fixes.  At this
  point, the env of an ebuild *should* be perfectly preserved, and used.  This deprecates
  portage.doebuild, in favor of eventually calling an ebuild.py:process_phase.  The 
  code of doebuild now exists as ebuild.py:__adjust_env.  That code needs cleanup, 
  and splitting.  Rough stats for the daemonized ebuild processor code is a 33% reduction
  in run time for a full regen, with the initial framework laid out to allow parallel
  regens on smp systems.  Aside from making all of the previous refactorings active
  (sync refactoring in emerge, transports refactoring in portage.py and repoman), this 
  adds the following-
  portage.exit_callbacks- append a function to this list, and it'll be called at shutdown
  FEATURES="verify-rdepend"- don't trust the packages stated rdepends, ldd the crap out of 
  the package to verify it.  When severe is on, bail, if unstated rdepends are encountered.
  FEATURES="prelink"- do prelinking of binaries after merging.  Initial patch submitted by
  Urilith.
  FEATURES="userpriv_fakeroot"- run the install phase in userpriv'd fakeroot instance, removing
  the root requirement for all building phases but setup
  FEATURES="confcache"- a implementation of stuart's confcache alg, minus the sandbox
  modifications.
  FEATURES="parallel-fetch"- bug #1661, fork and fetch while merging.  Requires distlocks to be 
  enabled, and only kicks in when more then one package is being merged.  This is based on 
  portage_exec.spawn_func, and depgraph.__fetch.
  Aside from the feature additions, a large amount of code shifting to break the need for 
  globals, and try to centralize the code for modularizing (this is the start of it).
  A large amount of code cleanup in addition.

  07 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild-default-functions.sh:
  Compatability hack to treat USE="selinux" as both a feature, and use.  With the 
  env saving/restoring, it's possible a binpkg is created on a non-selinux system- 
  the use vars are preserved and reused, so that systems USE="-selinux", merged on a 
  selinux system results in preinst's selinux code not being executed.  No labels.
  That's bad.

  07 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portageq.py: 
  Isolated functions from bin/portageq.

  07 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild: missing
  portage_util import.  Only exposed when intentionally bailing out of a
  phase that is executing.

  07 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild.sh, 
  bin/ebuild-default-functions.sh, bin/ebuild-function.sh, 
  bin/ebuild-isolated-functions.sh: Env clean ups, fixups.  Not compatable
  with doebuild at this commit, since it tries to write back via pipes.  
  To make it compatible (should a revert occur), define an appropriate speak
  funciton.  This commit closes out #52652, #51552, #51370, #46223, potential issues
  from installed ebuilds not functioning correctly due to assuming use/has behave a
  certain way #40993, ultimately #56408.  Essentially, this is all the required
  bash modifications to properly save/restore the env, allowing for ebuilds to 
  be uninstalled despite eclasses/ebuilds no longer existing.  Also contains a 
  fair amount of protective code, since older env savings were incorrect.  Additionally,
  it properly restores variables attributes- export fex, shopt, etc.  This is the basis
  of the ebuild-daemon.
  Finally, adds (pre|post) hooks for all relevant ebuild phases.  Required, since 
  /etc/portage/bashrc is sourced only once.

  07 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage_util.py: 
  fixed import issue.

  07 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> portage_dep.py: code
  transfer out of portage.py.  Functions are still in portage.py at this point, 
  removed shortly.  Closes a few bugs with paren_reduce not returning a list, 
  but a tuple also.

  07 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> portage_db_template.py,
  portage_db_flat.py: Addition of get_timestamp, way of requesting -just- the
  mtime.  Useful for speeding up checking if an entry is stale, if the mtime 
  differs, no need to read the file in- you know it's stale already.  Cuts down
  on a few syscalls.

  07 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> sync/__init__.py, 
  sync/parseuri.py, sync/cvs.py, sync/rsync.py, sync/snapshot.py, 
  bin/emerge-webrsync: Rewrite of Marius Mauch's (genone) sync refactoring code.  
  Relies on the transport refactoring for snapshots module.  This obsoletes 
  emerge-webrsync.  Supports old SYNC format for cvs, and new- new being
  SYNC="cvs://[CVS_RSH:]user@host:cvsroot:cvs-module".  New is preferred, otherwise
  have to assume CVS_RSH=ssh, and cvs-module=gentoo-x86.  Example of new-
  SYNC="cvs://ssh:ferringb@cvs.gentoo.org:/var/cvsroot:gentoo-x86"
  The snapshot uri is a bit odd, possible to rework it I'd think- either
  SYNC="snapshot"
  which pulls a mirror to use from portage.thirdpartymirrors["gentoo"], or explicitly
  SYNC="snapshot-[mirror-uri]".  fex
  SYNC="snapshot-http://gentoo.chem.wisc.edu/gentoo/snapshots" would use 
  snapshots from gentoo.chem.wisc.edu. Sync uri for rsync is unchanged.
  This is just the requisite code, the conversion to emerge to use it shall follow.
  (#35535).

  07 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> transports/__init__.py,
  transports/bundled_lib.py, transports/fetchcommand.py: Fetch refactoring.
  Basically, a rewrite of portions of getbinpkg in httpConnection, and ftpConnection.
  Those classes are hidden behind BundledConnection, which has an api that is 
  the same as fetchcommand.py:CustomConnection- that class abstracts the parsing and
  handling of (FETCH|RESUME)COMMAND, and their protocol specific settings into a central
  class.  Code isn't in use as of this commit, but will be in use once ebd's code is 
  fully in cvs (portage.py commit essentially).  The sync refactoring also uses it.
  bug #23327 also is addressed, although it's ancillary- bundledConnection is able
  to handle specific user/passwd, although for fetchcommand, we need to add a specific
  user/password set of variables.

  07 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> orig_dict_cache.py:
  Transfer of the cacheddir func out of portage.py, and into it's own module.
  Current implementation isn't symlink aware, and has other issues (follow_symlinks
  fex).  This shift of it is intended so replacing it just involves creation and 
  importation of an alternative caching module.

  07 Nov 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> portage_exec.py, 
  portage_checksums.py, portage_gpg.py, portage_const.py, portage_util.py,
  portage_locks.py:  Code cleanup, moves, and shifting away from 
  commands.gso to portage_exec.spawn_get_output.  Multiple additions to 
  portage_exec adding fakeroot support, a native collect status output, 
  and centralized code for killing off a set of pids.  Correction to 
  portage_exec so that the spawned_list is correctly pruned- previously it 
  was a list of _all_ pids spawned, so portage could try to kill off a pid 
  that was previous a child, but by chance a new process runs as (depends on
  how random the pid selection is).  Aside from changes to cleanup, these changes
  are mostly standalone.
  Additionally, moved selinux context switching into portage_exec post-fork- 
  just specify the desired selinux_context, and it'll make the switch- if
  portage_exec.selinux_capable, it makes the switch.  Otherwise, it ignores it.
  Finally, new function added, spawn_func.  Pass in a python function, it'll fork,
  then call the function w/ the args/kwargs passed to it- optionally using an additional
  passed in function to interpret the results, and return an appropriate exitcode.
  Also, a *large* amount of inline documentation is contained in this commit.

  07 Nov 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> dispatch-conf: Moved back
  to the version of dispatch-conf that was released (due to python-2.2
  compatibility) and fixed a small type in that version. #70282

  07 Nov 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> portage_dep.py emerge: Added
  a few more readable optimizations to the DependencyGraph class along with
  apprioriate comments. Changed all usage of digraph in emerge to use the new
  DependencyGraph class.

  06 Nov 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> portage_dep.py emerge:
  Added full code comments to the DependencyGraph class. Did some code
  optimization where readability was not adversly affected. Removed the
  testing output from emerge.

  06 Nov 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> portage_dep.py emerge:
  Added a reimplementation of digraph. Still some work to do (including
  comments) in order to support the differences between *DEPEND. Modified
  emerge a little to build up both dep graphs for testing purposes.

  05 Nov 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> doins: Added vapier's fix
  for doins changing existing directory permissions. #69896

  Reordered a cache update and a return statement so that the cache is
  actually updated in ververify. #69523

  31 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild: Added missing
  portage_util import.

  29 Oct 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> emerge: Close stdin after 
  the spawn fork for rsync, not in global scope.  #68946

  29 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed issue where
  emerge adds package to world when --onlydeps is specified. #69260
  Fixed issue where emerge was adding packages to world when --uprade is
  specified even if the package is already installed. #69287 Fixed logic
  in path/to/ebuild check so that symlinks do not cause false positives.

  29 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> dispatch-conf: Added usata's
  fix for mac-os compatibility. #69304

  29 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> getbinpkg.py: Reversed the
  logic of ftp passive-mode selection. #69371

  28 Oct 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> portage.py: Closed out 
  an issue with config.reset() gradually nuking items out of backupenv- 
  identified by Ludovic Aubry, solved w/ his provided fix. (#69388)

  28 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> emergehelp.py: Fixed up
  some incorrect descriptions. Added documentation for new and changed

  loop from the userquery function. #69020

  27 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> dispatch-conf: Moved temp file
  creation into a safe directory under /tmp. Made the log file a configurable
  option that is disabled by default.

  26 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> portage.py:  Added a check to
  portdbapi.fetchcheck to account for a missing digest.

  26 Oct 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> portage_exec.py, bin/ebuild:
  bug with the path lookup code (added find_binary func for upcoming additions), 
  and bin/ebuild was bailing due to a missing portage_util import.

  25 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> portage.py: Wrapped entire
  lock-holding section of fetch() in a try-finally to ensure that the lock
  file gets released regardless of exception.

  25 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> etc-update: Added patch
  from #48218 to continue on to next file when answering "no" to the
  interactive replace prompt of menu option -3.

  25 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed the space/tab
  usage through the spinner_msgs definition. Removed COMPILER from emerge info
  output.

  25 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> portage.py: Converted
  config.pkeywordsdict from {atom:[keyword]} to {cp:{atom:[keyword]}} to
  prevent a lot of unnecessary calculation.

  24 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> emerge: Added a percentage
  counter to the cache update phase based on patch from #68694

  24 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> portage.py:
  s/macos/ppc-macos/ change.

  24 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> portage_locks.py
  portage_db_flat.py: Fixed a couple of race conditions with regard to
  stating files.

  23 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> portage.py portage_util.py:
  Added syntax checking for package.mask, package.unmask and packages files.

  23 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> dohtml: Reimplemented the
  option processing to remove the dependency on optparse.

  23 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> repoman: Made the invalid
  profile slightly more intelligable and got rid of the duplicate. Moved
  the profile KEYWORDS.invalid failure so that it only occurs if the
  corresponding KEYWORD is valid.

  23 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> portage.py: Added settings
  parameter to dep_virtual as the virtuals can now change during dep graph
  creation. #68220

  23 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> repoman: Changed repoman to
  use the first stable profile found for each arch listed in profiles.desc
  rather than the last profile listed. Added notification on any invalid
  profile in profiles.desc. Made exception into a repoman error where a
  ebuild is using a keyword for which no profile can be found.

  23 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> repoman: Fixed traceback in
  repoman on invalid LICENSE syntax.

  22 Oct 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: silencing use/has.

  22 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> emerge: Added python version
  to "emerge info" output.

*portage-2.0.51-r2 (20 Oct 2004): Everyone loves finding bugs in stable!

  20 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed the result
  checking when ebuilds are called -- this removes the continuing-after failure
  big discovered by AMD64 today.

  20 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed a bug where
  users were warned against emerging by path when a file/dir exists of the
  same name of the package to be merged. #68372  Added an warning with delay
  when emerging an ebuild that is masked.  Added a check on PORTAGE_GPG_DIR
  which removes "gpg" from FEATURES on an invalid settings. #68387

*portage-2.0.51 (20 Oct 2004): Everyone loves stable!

  19 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.5: patch included
  to fix a few typos.

  19 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> g-cpan.pl patch included
  that doesn't recreate inherently-created ebuilds.

  20 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> repoman: Added check for
  digest entries that aren't used within the corresponding ebuild's SRC_URI.

  20 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> emerge: Added support for
  EMERGE_WARNING_DELAY defaulting it to 10. Changed all the hardcoded delays
  to use it. Needed for the catalyst guys as it includes a number of unmerges
  of system packages.

  20 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> emerge: Changed the
  /path/to/ebuild warning. Added a check on what ebuild is chosen and
  a failure if it doesn't match what was specified. Added the same for
  /path/to/tbz2.

*portage-2.0.51_rc10 (19 Oct 2004): Potential Final #1.

  19 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Visual acuity
  enhancements. Fixed all the spaces in the option handling.

  19 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge.1: Updated for
  'f' and 'S'.

  19 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> getbinpkg.py: Potential
  fix for a missing dict key.

  19 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Prelink
  tempfile per pid.

  18 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> *.py: Added a protocol
  change for cPickles to make them more efficient (binary).

  18 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> sandbox: Fixes for some
  incorrect indexes that cause some boxes to have very random issues.

  18 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_locks.py: Reverted
  the lock code to the lockf()+hardlock version as the new code has some
  inexplicable incompatibility with NFS.
  
  18 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_exception.py: Added
  a couple exceptions pretaining specifically to packages and digests.

  18 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_checksum.py: Now
  takes care of missing files better for the partial-digest handling.

  18 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed up some
  of the output lines to use writemsg instead of print. Adjusted the fetch
  code to handle partial-digests. digestCreate can substitute in old digest
  entries now for missing files -- the assumption is that they are correct.
  Portage no longer downloads all parts when FEATURES=cvs is enabled, but
  does require a complete digest to commit, whether it was created piecewise
  or en masse. Added 'fetch_check' to portdbapi which helps with with emerge's
  pretend output for Fetch-Restriction.

  18 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> repoman: Added in support
  for partial-digests -- It complains, downloads, and adjusts. Sorted the QA
  categories to make them easier to scan.

  18 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Added -F to force
  all URIs to be downloaded. Added in a green, lowercase 'f' when the fetch
  restriction is satisfied for pretend. Added Kevin Quinn's patch for some
  prepstrip sanity and friendliness regarding TEXTRELs.

  18 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Added a message
  about use/useq/usev. CCACHE_DIR and CCACHE_SIZE are now properly exported.
  
  17 Oct 2004; <genone@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py:
  Added a followSymlinks parameter to listdir() as otherwise it gets stuck in
  an infinite loop when it encounters self-referencing symlinks, this behavior
  was exhibited by the collision-protect feature.

  17 Oct 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> portage-locks.py: Tweaked 
  unlockfile, no point in attempting to relock the file for deletion, if you're 
  not deleting the lockfile (basically moved locking w/in if unlinkfile).

  17 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> emerge portage_locks.py:
  Added more information to the --inject deprecation notice. Removed the sleep
  call from unlockfile as it severely affects performance (apparently only
  under some schedulers)

  16 Oct 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> portage_locks.py: Corrected 
  a bug involving unlocking + lockf.

  12 Oct 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> portage_exec.py: spawn_sandbox
  wasn't passing the opt_name down to spawn, it now does.

  11 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs; <jstubbs@gentoo.org> emerge: Reverted back to
  previous command line parsing code as --search options were being mishandled.

  11 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fix for the
  SHA1 digest slipout and the exec missing/broken binary traceback.

  11 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> pym/*: See below.

  11 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/*: Added catching and
  propogating of SystemExit exception to all blanket exception handlers.

  11 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> repoman: Fixed repoman LICENSE
  check to accept || () conditions.

*portage-2.0.51_rc8 (10 Oct 2004): RC + Lock cleanup, Happy RC #4

  10 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Added in close()
  calls to ensure that control-C gets intercepted by portage instead of the
  children. Added in a re-raise for the SysExit exception inside of the
  regen and metadata targets.
  
  10 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> cnf/make.conf*:
  benno@nietvergeten.nl's touchups to make.conf files.

  10 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> sandbox/*: Includes one
  of solar's patches to fix up potential holes in sandbox.

  10 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_exec.py: Added
  a cleanup routine.

  10 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: A could cwd
  fixes and removed the compat-writing for digests.

  10 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> md5check/mirror: brought
  them more up to date for the digest changes.

  10 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Moved the imports
  around to ensure that portage.py gives output on failure instead of emerge
  just dying. Added '-1' as a short for oneshot. Added shorter messages for
  the titlebar. Fixed signal handling more -- Emerge sets up a handler that
  calls to portageexit() before quitting normally.

  10 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Changed around
  the tarvars to make them STAR friendly. Added ECONF_SOURCE as a way to move
  econf out of the source directory and into a new build directory -- it
  defines the path to configure, not the command. Added CTARGET support. Added
  an rm for the infodir entries installed by autoconf so they don't kill what
  portage regens and vice versa.

  10 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> doins: Added Spanky's
  recursion patch.

  10 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> dolib: Added Spanky's
  symlink fix and condensed dolib*.

  10 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> doman: Added Spanky's
  i18n patch.

  08 Oct 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> portage_exec.py: Removed 
  the portage_exec.spawn_bash call for tee logging- instead, transferred in 
  some code that does path lookups (closer to the older portage.spawn call).
  Path lookup by default is on, but can be disabled via path_lookup=False.

  08 Oct 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> portage_locks.py: Reverted 
  to using flock by default- if it fails (unavailable), -then- use lockf, then
  hardlink.

  07 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> portage.py: Updated
  portdbapi.getfetchsizes function for new digestParseFile return values.

  05 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> quickpkg: Fixed bug whereby
  creating a package from within /var/db/pkg/cat and specifying pkg would
  create a broken package.

  05 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> emerge: Modified output for
  slotted installations. #26139

  05 Oct 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> emerge: Refactored argv
  processing a little bit and made "emerge rsync" to emerge rsync with notice
  and "emerge --rsync" to emerge --sync with notice.

  05 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_util.py: grabfile
  now handles a compat_level option for comment-based compatability changes --
  This feature is for migration only and is thus transitory.

  05 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_exception: Added
  a DigestException which is a SignatureException.

  05 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> perform_checksum.py: Added
  a perform_all() and verify_all() functions that handle the new dict of hashes
  that digestParse returns -- It creates hashes for all the listed/known
  formats or verifies them all returning a tuple of ok,reason.

  05 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Cleared up
  a few system-package import-alls (stat,commands) -- If it breaks something,
  they can fix their code -- They are standard modules. Removed the import
  for select, as it appears nowhere in usage. Changed the portage_data import.
  Added exithandler() back into usage, it was disabled -- Also corrected it's
  handling. Unified the digest-parsing code and made it into an intelligable
  dict instead of the fixed format. Merged digest functions and added SHA1
  (arbitrary) handling in a new COMPAT mode using comments until we get the
  handling transitioned into common usage. digestCreateLines() handles the
  compatibility line values, and grabfile() has a compat-level handler.

  05 Oct 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> man/*: Random touchups.

  04 Oct 2004; <jstubbs@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: Added fix for config
  protection failure when destination is a symlink. #13007

  04 Oct 2004; <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/repoman: Added detection of multiple
  overlays to repoman.

  04 Oct 2004; <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/repoman: Added repoman check
  for DEPEND-syntax following LICENSEs.

  03 Oct 2004; <genone@gentoo.org> pym/emergehelp.py:
  Add --metadata documentation to --help output.

  03 Oct 2004; <genone@gentoo.org> cnf/*, man/emerge.1, man/make.conf.5, 
  man/portage.5, pym/emergehelp.py:
  Changed documentation to use --action instead of action (bug #2365). 
  Also changed ufed references in make.conf to use the correct category.

*portage-2.0.51_rc7 (30 Sep 2004): RC + Lock cleanup, Happy RC #3

  30 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Rsync fix part 2
  for the distfiles, local, and packages directory unlinks.
  
  30 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge-webrsync: Fix for
  the missing md5sum causing failure to download. Fixed up a couple messages.
  Modified the local rsync line.
  
  30 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Make more of
  the chown calls friendly. More output on strange exceptions in aux_get.
  
  30 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_db_template.py:
  Added some more putput to the corruption message.

  29 Sep 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> output.py: Added unicode-rxvt
  to the list of legal term types. #65762

  28 Sep 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> etc-update: Added patch to
  use gsed on BSD from bug 60721.

*portage-2.0.51_rc6 (26 Sep 2004): RC + Lock cleanup, Happy RC #2

  26 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Restart fix for
  the -a into execv code.
  
  26 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_locks.py: Fixed
  a traceback for Fat32 users.

*portage-2.0.51_rc5 (26 Sep 2004): RC + Lock cleanup, Happy RC #1

  26 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_data.py: Fixed
  the BSD lchown issues.

  26 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Added the
  selinux secure dirs patch.

  26 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Modified the
  spinner again, --nospinner provides a basic ticker of one '.' per 100,
  normal spinner is the twirly one, and the FEATURES=candy spinner is a
  scrolly message.
  
  26 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_locks.py: Fixed it.
  Discovered that the hardlocks were failing due to the creation of the lock
  prior to the link operation which was due to the NFS fcntl lock failure.
  
  26 Sep 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: Added
  support for per profile package.mask. Included check of packages file
  to ensure that the profile depends on an adequate portage version.

*portage-2.0.51_rc4 (26 Sep 2004): RC + Lock cleanup

  26 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> bin/clean_locks: A new
  tool to aid in the maintainence of hardlock-based locks. It can clean
  all locks from a directory or just the ones pertinent to the running host.

  26 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Updated the
  spinner.

  26 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> cnf/*: Added distlocks
  as a default feature. Added comments on distlocks and maketest and gpg.

  26 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_locks.py: Lots
  of changes. Corrected the lockfile code to be an IOError. Added some
  helper functions to reduce duplication in the hardlink code. Added a
  callback to a cleanup function registered with atexit to ensure we clean
  locks up on normal terminations. Fixed the code to actually work on most
  NFS systems and hopefully have the fallback (INODE test) working on
  very broken systems. Added a cleanup function that is interfaced through
  the clean_locks script and the registered atexit call.

*portage-2.0.51_rc3 (26 Sep 2004): And we have another Release Candidate!

  26 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Modified the
  spinner.
  
  26 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_db_flat.py: Fixed
  a lockfile descriptor leak due to duplicated lock calls.

  26 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_lock.py: Added
  more cleanup to the lockfile descriptors.

*portage-2.0.51_rc2 (25 Sep 2004): And we have another Release Candidate!

  25 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_db_flat.py: Fix
  for typos.

  25 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_locks.py: Changed
  all the calls to lockf which wraps fcntl. Made the chown on the locks
  optional -- if it fails, it'll be annoying, but there's a message. Added
  code to perform the hardlink-shuffle which uses hardlinks as a locking
  mechanism (NFSv2 needs this).

  25 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_db_flat.py:
  Added locking around the file creation to ensure atomicity.
  
  25 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_localization.py:
  A little spot to provide the '_' function and examples and future code.

  25 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_file.py: Added
  the module to contain file/directory functions that are useful. Additional
  function 'makedirs' handles creation of directories with recursive perms.
  
  25 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> getbinpkg.py: Fixed the
  exception handling to not traceback.
  
  25 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> etc-update: Typo fix.
  
  25 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Caused the
  binary metadata downloading to be a little more verbose. Fixed the
  sync command's arguments so that it deletes top level files.

  25 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Added
  Cretin's patch for prelink blacklists. Increased the verbosity of the
  'mylines' output to let people know what files are affected with nulls.
  Added a workaround for a race condition that somehow exists inside of
  auxget when there is heavy lockfile contention -- Must be a lockfile
  cleanup issue.

  25 Sep 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> emerge: Modified env_update
  to always run ldconfig if makelinks is True, in order to ensure that
  missing symlinks are created. Added logic to treewalk to check if package
  is being downgraded and only run env_update with makelinks=False in that
  case. (#54655)

  24 Sep 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> emerge: Added the removal
  of --ask from argv when restarting after an emerge of portage. (#47379)

  21 Sep 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> portage_util.py: Changed
  varexpand to convert '\'-prepended newline chars to space rather than '\n'.

  21 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed the
  bintree ebuild locating. Removed the virts_p debug/bug statements.
  
  21 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_checksum: Added
  a fix for checksum tracebacks that tracebacked.
  
  21 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Added more
  variables to vardb.

  21 Sep 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> emerge: Added (slightly
  modified) patch from bug 64682.

  16 Sep 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> portage.py: Modified
  getmaskingstatus() to use settings.prevmaskdict rather than reading packages
  directly in support of cascading profiles.

*portage-2.0.51_rc1 (25 Sep 2004): And we have a Release Candidate!

  15 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild: On merge, disable
  the noauto feature explicitly.

  15 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed the
  'missing ebuild' for uninstalls of packages not in the tree.

  15 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> man/*: Started adding
  to the documentation in order to break it an make it look funny. Added a
  couple entries for missing concepts like 'inherit' and 'useq' and 'hasq'.
  Cleared up a few things here and there with usage. Added in the metadata
  target for emerge.

*portage-2.0.51_pre24 (14 Sep 2004): Last _pre before docs and rc/stable.

  14 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> repoman: Extra handling
  for weird CVS/Repository info on OSX.

  14 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed a traceback
  in traceback handling where a value was trying to be extracted from an
  exception. Handled the case where a binary package does not have an ebuild
  in a tree or overlay and the verbose overlay output requires it. Change to
  the CVS checkouts for emerge sync, moved the -P immediately after the co.

  14 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_exception.py:
  Added in some spacing between related exception groups.

  14 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Changed a bunch
  of lines unnecessarily to start getting the locale strings ready -- I'll
  probably have bugs due to this because I've been doing dumb things like
  that recently. 

  14 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> man/*: Fixed ka0ttic's
  email address.

  14 Sep 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild.sh: Removed 
  the ${T}/successful logic, it's no longer needed.  Existed only for the 
  $0 "$@" 2>&1 | tee $PORTAGE_LOG trickery, which is now handled via
  portage_exec.spawn.

  13 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fix for empty
  categories/portage-tree causing a traceback.
  
*portage-2.0.51_pre23 (11 Sep 2004): Fixes and stuff.

  11 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Another fix
  to the virtuals/use code -- It wasn't using treeVirtuals.

  11 Sep 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed breakage
  in cacheddir changes upon stat'ing a broken symlink.

  11 Sep 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed missing
  check in autouse function. Fixed out-of-bounds exception on catpkgsplit

  circular deps of vardbapi and config.

*portage-2.0.51_pre21 (09 Sep 2004): Fixes and stuff.

  09 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Possible fix
  for autouse() that will prevent recursion and locks.
  
*portage-2.0.51_pre210 (09 Sep 2004): (pre-pre release for 21)
  
  09 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> archive-conf: Added patch
  so that it runs.
  
  09 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> dispatch-conf: Added patch
  to die when rcs isn't installed but is required by options.
  
  09 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Solar's checks
  for suid bind issues.
  
  09 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> fixvardbentries: Updated
  to Jason's current script.
  
  09 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> g-cpan.pl: Added a fix
  to store the ebuilds in a defined overlay.
  
  09 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> output.py: Added all
  xterm* terms to the title-list.
  
  09 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed the
  cascade/stack functions -- use.defaults is fully line-incremental now.
  Removed a lot of cruft commented-code. Added an ebuild-mover into the
  entry move functions.
  
  09 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_util.py: Placed
  the lex code into a try/except so we can add the filename into the error
  that is passed back from shlex.
  
  08 Sep 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> portage.py: Modified
  config.__init__(clone=1) so that profiles list is preserved, allowing for 
  all profile's bashrc's to be sourced.

  06 Sep 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed 
  fetch logic for when DISTDIR isn't writable, but the file is fully 
  fetched already (#62985).

  05 Sep 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> portage.py ebuild.sh:
  Added use flag support to RESTRICT; usual syntax.

  04 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_data.py: Added
  FreeBSD as a BSD-type OS and merged the Darwin branch with them.

  04 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_contents.py: The
  parsing portion of a persistent contents file parser that can return the
  owner of a particular file or directory by parsing (and storing) data from
  the contents files.

  04 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_const.py: Added
  LOCALE_DATA_PATH to the constants for future gettext (internal) support.

  04 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> output.py: Fixed the
  title changes to no clear the icon title.

  04 Sep 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> prepman: No longer
  gzip's symlinks -- This needs to gain 'target changed' logic.

  01 Sep 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py:
  Cleaned up the imports, cutting down on from blah import *, instead 
  importing only what is strictly needed for backards compatability.

  01 Sep 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage_exec.py:
  Nick caught this- changed setgid/setuid order so it works.

  01 Sep 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py:
  Added Michael Stewart's patch correcting optional args being specified 
  via position- bug #61881.

  01 Sep 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py, 
  pym/portage_exec.py, pym/portage_checksum.py: Restructured spawn
  so that we don't have two versions; all spawn calls trace back to 
  portage_exec.spawn, either through spawn_bash or spawn_sandbox.
  portage_exec.spawn is strictly an os.execve wrapper now, so bash 
  doesn't have to be involved unless desired (if desired use spawn_bash).

  31 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/emerge: Debug
  print statement left in global scope, corrected it.

  31 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_checksum.py:
  Solar's patch to check if prelink binary exists prior to executing it.

  31 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_checksum.py:
  Only prelink-check when requested -- This is only valid for merge/unmerge
  operations -- Also happens to fix the access violations in portageq.

  31 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Adjustments
  for the prelink-check changes.

  31 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_exception.py:
  Made the exceptions more hierarchial. Yes, I'm aware I can't speel.

  30 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/repoman: Added 
  solar's patch to make the file.size check display the size of the 
  offender.

  30 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py, 
  pym/portage_util.py: Removed -all- duplicate function definitions between 
  portage_util and portage.  This is just -begging- for a bug where 
  portage.py's definitions are fixed, but portage_util isn't.
  If you're moving code out of portage.py (good thing) please yank the def 
  from portage.py.  Especially if you're importing everything from new 
  home of the module.

  30 Aug 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> pym/emerge: Added python 2.2
  compatibility fix. (#62128) Added fix to fail nicely on missing
  /etc/gentoo-release. (#62149)

  30 Aug 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: Fixed two
  bugs in bindbapi.aux_get() preventing retrieval of information about tbz2s.

  26 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/etc-update: minor 
  tweak to etc-update to support single quotes in /etc/etc-update.conf
  bug (#56785).  Added Mamoru Komachi (usata)'s fix for osx (#60721).

  26 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py, 
  pym/portage_exec.py, bin/ebuild.sh: Removed the PORT_LOGDIR $0 $* | tee 
  hack, and re-implemented it using spawn.  Spawn has been extended so that 
  fd_pipes can receive a dict of fd # -> fd, and optionally be nonblocking 
  via returnpid.  portage.spawn has support for a logfile optional arg- if 
  specified, spawn logs stdout/stderr via tee -i -a to the specified file.
  Note portage_exec.spawn doesn't currently support this option.

  25 Aug 2004; <genone@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py, +pym/portage_checksum.py, 
  pym/portage_gpg.py, -pym/portage_md5.py:
  renamed portage_md5 to portage_checksum which includes support for sha1.

  24 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.ogr> bin/ebuild.sh: Tweak to
  dyn_test to check if $S exists prior to cd'ing to it.

  24 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: Fixed a 
  traceback issues in dblink.treewalk when collision-protect is active.  
  Also added specific check/complaint for PORT_LOGDIR='' to the config class,
  since it should either not be set, or something non-null- a null 
  PORT_LOGDIR triggers a traceback in doebuild do to an attempted chmod.

  23 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: Added a 
  macos ranlib hack; dblink.mergeme by default resets each files mtime, which 
  makes static archives merged to the fs worthless (linker notes the files 
  mtime differs from an internal mtime, and bails).  This closes out bug 
  (#58848), and will be obsoleted when refcounts are used instead of mtime + 
  md5.

  21 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild.sh: Expanded
  CONF_LIBDIR support, so it honors --prefix set values. (#61060)

  19 Aug 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/repoman: Added
  FEATURES and USE to the readonly variable check.

  17 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage_data.pym:
  Adding missing imports.

  17 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/repoman: Minor 
  tweak to make repoman detect the repolevel correctly in overlays.
  (#60298).

*portage-2.0.51_pre20 (16 Aug 2004): Fixes and Public Readiness & GPG
  
  16 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed the
  imports and new modules so that the API remains constant.

  16 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_exec.py: Created
  for external operations and calls. Presently contains spawn. Mostly for
  prevention of circular imports.

  16 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_md5.py: using
  the spawn call from portage_exec.py to avoid the circular import.

  16 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/repoman: Fixed a 
  traceback related to file.size and --fix, added compatability tweaks for
  xmllint.

  16 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed the lock
  handling and unique_array calls.

*portage-2.0.51_pre19 (16 Aug 2004): Fixes and Public Readiness & GPG
  
  16 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Add predict
  for gpg verification.

  16 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed the
  lock code to use the external module.

  16 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_gpg.py: Fixed
  the writing operations and access violations.

  16 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_locks.py: Fixed
  the code so it acutally works and is used.

  16 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_md5.py: Fixed
  the lock calls.

*portage-2.0.51_pre18 (16 Aug 2004): Fixes and Public Readiness & GPG
  
  16 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> dolib*: Added LV's
  CONF_LIBDIR patch to help out the 32/64 bit lib migrations.
  
  16 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: CONF_LIBDIR
  patch updates. Added a possible fix for the export issues in environment.

  16 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> prepall/lib: CONF_LIBDIR

  16 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Adjusted the
  manifest/gpg code to reduce the output on missing sigs. Changed the GPG
  homedir to the PORTAGE_GPG_DIR instead of using rsync for the keyring --
  This requires manual intervention.

  16 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> sandbox: Added the 32/64
  paths in for 32/64 lib migrations.

  16 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/cvstree.py 
  pym/portage.py: Round #2 of ignorecvs, now w/ sane regex goodness and an 
  addition to digest(gen|check) to use the same cvs filter for Manifests.
  (#46070).

  15 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: message fix for
  packages.provided.

  15 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> repoman: Made file.size
  a warning for the time being.

  15 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> cvstree.py: Removed the
  auto-ignore regex as it is broken AND it breaks Manifests due to excess
  files allowed into them.

  15 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: A couple changes
  to the select_dep exception handling for the signing code.

  15 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> env-update.sh: Added
  Spanky's env-update  shell script version.
  
  15 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Moved more
  code into seperate modules. Added support for Manifest verification and
  usage of 'gpg' 'strict' 'severe' to enable various condition responses.
  
  15 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_const.py: Moved
  all constants to this module. (All uppercase defines)

  15 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_data.py: Contains
  all calculated information. uid/gid info. system-specific values. All probed
  information should go here.
  
  15 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_exception.py:
  Added many exceptions for the GPG verification code. Added many general
  exceptions to help differentiate from explicit portage exceptions and
  those issued by python.
  
  15 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_gpg.py: Handling
  of gpg verification code and keyring management/trust.
  
  15 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_locks.py: Moved
  the lock code out of portage.py.

  15 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_md5.py: Moved the
  MD5 calculation code out of portage.py.

  15 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_util.py: Moved
  writemsg and unique_array into portage_util.

  13 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild.sh: Added 
  support for ECONF_LIBDIR; if it isn't defined, then --libdir isn't 
  passed to the configure script.  If it is defined, then the configure 
  script gets --libdir=/usr/${ECONF_LIBDIR}.

  13 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/cvstree.py: 
  Added robbat2's patch to ignore files that cvs ignores. (#46070). 

  13 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild.sh: Shifted 
  the add* sandbox function definitions to before profile.bashrc srcing.
  As bug #60147 demonstrated, profiles occasionally need to adjust 
  SANDBOX_WRITE (current case being for /usr/lib64/{conftest,cf}).

  13 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/emerge: Related to 
  bug #60256, adjusted format_size so that is always returns a string.

  13 Aug 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/emerge:
  Relocated blocker checking code to before pkgsettings.setcpv() is called
  on it in depgraph.create()

  13 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: 
  Tweaked lockfile, so it attempts a non-blocking lock_ex first, then
  states it's waiting on lock blar, then attempts a blocking lock.  This 
  will be useful for informing the user why portage seems to have hung, 
  and good for debugging.

  13 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/emerge-webrsync:
  Added support for snapshot md5sum's (mirrors now carry them).
  This is used to ensure the fetched snapshot is sane; if it's sane, 
  then we reuse it for sync'ing.  This nulls the -n option, so it's been
  removed. Closes out #15990, but no longer automatically forcing a refetch.
  Refetches are only forced if the md5 is invalid.

  12 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: 
  Cleaned up fetch a bit more, saner error messages when unable to 
  write to DISTDIR.

  12 Aug 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/emerge:
  Fixed the fix for the earlier traceback on installed package not being
  in PORTDIR to remove duplicate work.

  11 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild.sh: 
  Added FEATURES="autoconfig" support. (#55476)

  11 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: 
  Added check to lockfile and fetch, if file already is owned by 
  portage group, don't try and chown it.  This will close #60079.

  10 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/emerge: Fixed a 
  traceback issue, an ebuild is no longer in the tree, but is installed 
  and needs to be used in the depgraph- the problem was, emerge 
  assumed the ebuild was in porttree's db, when vartree should be used 
  if the package is known to be installed.

  10 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py:
  Killed a couple of corner cases for non-root fetch and lockfile calls.

  10 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py
  bin/ebuild.sh: Add check to ensure that install phase has been 
  ran prior to qmerge phase being attempted.  This can happen 
  when the user is using ebuild to step through the phases.
  Corrected bug in listdir where it would return None, rather then 
  []- all callee's expect a returned list, not None.  Same for ftype,
  cause's a tb if you just haphazardly rely on cachedir's return.

  09 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: 
  Leave /var/tmp with it's own permissions, chowning/chmoding just 
  /var/tmp/portage (#37521).

  09 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild.sh 
  pym/portage.py: Corrected bug in profile.bashrc support, added aliases 
  for saving/restoring IFS (remove_path_entry and profile.bashrc loop 
  adjust IFS temporarily).  Closes #59749.

  08 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> dispatch-conf: 
  Converted os.rename calls to shutil.move; the former can't cross fs's,
  the latter can. (#46148)

  07 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed the
  cache updates so that an env-update forces ld updating.
  
  07 Aug 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py
  pym/portage_dep.py: Added a new parameter to use_reduce so that !arch?
  checks can be adhered to even when matchall=1 and arch is not is masklist.

  07 Aug 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py
  pym/portage_dep.py: Added profile masked use flags to repoman check.
  Moved || refactoring to a separate function. Reworked use_reduce logic
  into simpler sections.

  05 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage_dep.py:
  What can I say, I can't get enough of bug (#59574).
  I'm operating under the assumption there still is a bug in the 
  use_reduce logic, soo I've left a fairly massive amount of debugging 
  code in place that's currently disabled.  It's *very* useful for 
  tracking exactly what/how use_reduce decides on a operator node.

  05 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: 
  I introduced a bug in the previous commit, basically 
  portage.settings.archlist list of arch keywords was being actively 
  pruned by repoman as it stepped through arches for dep checking.
  Basically, needed to make a copy of archlist rather then using the 
  actual archlist object.  Should be the final issue for (#59574).

  05 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: Fix 
  in the same area, if use="all" (repoman wants -every use flag- checked),
  it should call use_reduce w/ matchall set appropriately. (#59574)

  05 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: And...
  repoman's arch check got hosed again.  The code in dep_check for 
  building a masklist was incorrect, 3 line fix. (#59574)

*portage-2.0.51_pre17 (03 Aug 2004): Fixes and Public Readiness

  03 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_dep.py: Again
  fixed the || exceptions to understand nested legal || statements.

*portage-2.0.51_pre16 (03 Aug 2004): Fixes and Public Readiness

  04 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Changed the
  virtual/glibc references to virtual/libc.

  04 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> prepman: No longer runs
  gzip on .keep files.

  04 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> getbinpkg.py: Added in
  an active/passive option for FTP connections -- Requires the appending of
  an asterisk to the HOST portion of the ftp string to use active connections.

  04 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> make.conf*: Updates for
  the active-connection ftp option.

  04 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emergehelp.py: Removed
  the bin/ version and replaced it with a duplicated pym/ version.

  03 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: 
  Added check to ensure /var/tmp/portage's permissions were sane. (#56665)

  03 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/repoman: Added 
  explicit check for missing files directory, rather then ignoring it.
  Also added an explicit commit-time check for CVS/Entries being sane.
  (#57141).

  03 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/repoman: reworked 
  the qacats definition so that the type of bug that borked emerge help is 
  no longer possible.

  03 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py, 
  bin/emerge: Corrected emerge --fetch-all-uri issues, now works.  Basically,
  FEATURES="cvs" emerge -f blar == emerge --fetch-all-uri blar.  The fetch
  option handling in emerge could use some cleanup.

  03 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: Ongoing 
  cleanup in emerge -fp; this corrects a minor naggle affecting previous 
  releases, where emerge -fp would still attempt to do md5 checks on files.

  03 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: Corrected 
  logic for fetch(..., ..., use_locks=1,listonly=1) attempting to use locks, 
  when fetch is just printing the src_uri's.  (#59394).

  03 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/repoman: Corrected the
  borkage I introduced into repoman's help option- it was throwing a traceback
  due to file.executable's key name being typoed.

  03 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_dep.py: Enhanced
  the invalid depend string identification for || (and &&) strings.

*portage-2.0.51_pre15 (03 Aug 2003): Fixes and Public Readiness

  03 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/repoman: Corrected 
  typo, trying to remove .backup_metadata.dtd rather then metadata.dtd.

  03 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_dep.py: Changing
  from dep_opconvert to use_reduce introduced a bug due to how OR'd lists are
  managed by the remaining dep handling functions -- Fixed by emulating the
  format in use_reduce.

  02 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/repoman, pym/portage.py:
  Added local caching of metadata.dtd, to prevent flaky connections from 
  flagging a packages metadata.xml as invalid due to xmllint failing to fetch 
  metadata.dtd.  Simplified version of patch in (#57210).

  02 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild.sh, 
  pym/portage.py:  Added support for src'ing a profile bashrc.  Fex, if
  /etc/make.profile/profile.bashrc exists, it is sourced prior to ebuild.sh
  defining any of it's functions.  (#58415).

  02 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/emerge-webrsync: General
  cleanup; uses the make.conf defined FETCHCOMMAND for fetching (fixing #57887),
  runs emerge metadata after a successful sync also.

*portage-2.0.51_pre14 (02 Aug 2003): Fixes and Public Readiness

  02 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> do*: Added exit calls
  on failures and changed the install to use short options for BSD compat.
  
  02 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: unset
  GLOBIGNORE added. Echo out the confingure command from econf. Moved the
  maketest code to dyn_preinst so it didn't force-run maketest. Added a
  patch for keyword expansion (requires portage-2.0.51 for use).

  02 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: --fetch-all-uri
  added to force all URIs to be downloaded (works like features=cvs). libc
  version printing enhancements. Fixed the binary package selection in an
  alt ROOT. Headers and libtool added to info. --ask removed on a resume.
  
  02 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> prepstrip: Change ewarn
  to echos to stderr with beeps.
  
  02 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> repoman: Added to the
  OK message output for issues that fail.

  02 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> make.conf: Typo correction
  patch added.
  
  02 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> output.py: Added kterm
  to the titlebar terminals.

  02 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Added a message
  regarding the location of the virtuals file (move to /etc/portage/profile).
  Added a invalid-mirror message and a missing URI message for fetching. Added
  the selinux sandbox patch. Removed the old dep_opconvert call as all ?:
  syntax is gone.

  02 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_dep.py: Fixed the
  use_reduce code to properly handle negative requirements on masked flags.
  
  02 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> tbz2tool.c: Made all the
  comments to C style.

  02 Aug 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> libsandbox: Code from
  Seth Robertson that tracked down all adjuct flags for read operations that
  did not invoke a write operation.

  01 Aug 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> bin/emerge: Added
  message about ._cfg* files after emerge sync.

  01 Aug 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: Modified 
  updating /etc/portage/package.* logic to see  CONFIG_PROTECT and 
  CONFIG_PROTECT_MASK.

  01 Aug 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/emerge:
  Added a warning for `emerge /path/to/ebuild`

  01 Aug 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/emerge:
  Fixing broken logic for the `emerge rsync` deprecation notice (it only showed
  up on `emerge --rsync`).

  01 Aug 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py bin/emerge:
  Fixed the lockfile/unlockfile functions so that they correctly support having
  an int passed in (the fd #), or having a file object passed in.  Corrected 
  lockfile so that the lock is owned by portage group, with g+w permissions
  (this is needed since sudo emerge blar can bail, leaving a stale lock that 
  non-root usage cannot remove).  Added locking to emerge's emergelog function, 
  preventing log messages from potentially getting mixed together.  Added check 
  to fetch function to complain if unable to write to DISTDIR (previously the 
  fetcher just bailed, stepping through each src_uri).  Added lockfiles for 
  fetching/md5ing of the src- these lockfiles are stored in a subdirectory 
  (locks_in_subdir=".locks") if specified, and locking is controlled via 
  use_locks (defaults to on).  emerge -f no longer requires root/sudo to run 
  (ebuild never had this restriction). (#42969)

  31 Jul 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py bin/emerge:
  Removed USE-based SLOT support. Removed uselist from getslot methods.

  29 Jul 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/repoman: Added check for
  files over 20k in a packages files directory.  file.size, repoman treats it 
  as a a failure.  Added the repoman manpage entries for file.size, and 
  file.executable (I missed file.executable earlier).

  28 Jul 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: Fixed a bug
  emerge doesn't pkg_setup() with -k/-K option. (#25152)

  28 Jul 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py:
  Added ._cfg* file for updating /etc/portage/packages.* during global
  update.

  28 Jul 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> bin/emergehelp.py,
  man/emerge.1: Added explanation of --newuse to manpage/help. 
  Added information of --verbose to manpage.

  27 Jul 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py:
  Reversed the order of profile virtuals (dirVirtuals) so that a cascading
  profile's virtuals are stacked in the correct order.

  26 Jul 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/emerge:
  Removed the `which blah` calls- A) stage1 lacks which, B) which searches
  $PATH- all sane shells do this already when handed a command that 
  isn't absolute path.  These which calls were used in 
  commands.getstatusoutput() calls, which starts up a shell with
  the arg passed to the shell, so "`which blar` args" isn't needed.

  26 Jul 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/repoman:
  Added file.executable check- ebuilds, digests, Manifest, ChangeLog, and
  metadata.xml don't need the executable bit set.  CVS preserves it upon 
  commit, so we do the check prior to commit.  (#55647)

  26 Jul 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/emerge:
  Removed the hardcoding of uname for emerge info, using which to find it
  instead.

  26 Jul 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/repoman:
  Added check to ensure manifest recommit is at least possible when 
  committing, and corrected handling of CVS/Root files for OSX machines.
  Removed readline import, doesn't seem to be used at all.

  26 Jul 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/emerge pym/portage.py:
  Refactored slot code into portage.py to remove usage off portage_dep.

  25 Jul 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/dohtml:
  Corrected a bug in dohtml where it was unable to install files with a space 
  in their name (#58258)

  25 Jul 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/emerge pym/portage.py:
  Deprecated --inject and added support for package.provided in both the
  profiles and /etc/portage/profile directory.

  24 Jul 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/emerge pym/portage.py:
  Added USE flag based SLOT support.

  24 Jul 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/emerge pym/portage.py:
  Added USE flag based PROVIDE support. (#32114)

  24 Jul 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> src/sandbox-1.1/libsandbox.c:
  Fixed lchown sandbox bug. (#58084)

  23 Jul 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/repoman: Corrected a 
  false positive on the ebuild.nesteddie check.  Basically it wasn't looking 
  to see if the line was active or not (fex # (die), bash skips, but repoman 
  caught).  Aside from that, that check is still capable of missing multiline 
  ebuild.nesteddie instances.  (#33011)

  22 Jul 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild.sh: Re-enabled
  binary QA interceptors, with a minor twist- the QA_INTERCEPTORS is used to 
  specify what QA interceptors will be defined.  These functions are no longer
  saved in the ebuild's stored env (exist *only* in depend phase), and have been 
  expanded to identify if it's the ebuild, or eclass that's triggering the QA 
  Notice (#54652).  The interceptors behaviour when the binary is missing has 
  been corrected to correctly output "missing command $bin: args".

  21 Jul 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> bin/emerge: Fixed bug 
  which blocks a package itself with -U option.

  20 Jul 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> bin/repoman: Fixed
  profile cache problem. (#43601, #56170)

  20 Jul 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild.sh:
  added usev() and hasv() as complement to useq() and hasq().

  18 Jul 2004; Brian Harring <ferringb@gentoo.org> bin/repoman: Corrected 
  ebuild.allmasked check, so that it checks for an available version across all
  arches, rather then the last arch processed.  Typo fixed also- bugs #57356 and
  #57068.

  17 Jul 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/repoman: Added patch from
  #49126 that makes repoman check that a USE flag from use.local.desc applies
  to the packages that make use of it.

  14 Jul 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/emerge:
  added a deprecation warning for --upgradeonly

  14 Jul 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/etc-update:
  Added a hint to etc-update so people that don't know what to do don't use -3
  or -5 by accident.

  12 Jul 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/emerge:
  Adjusted masked binary checking code to exclude --usepkgonly.

  10 Jul 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> man/portage.5:
  Adjusted documentation for user use.mask to match implementation.

*portage-2.0.51_pre13 (09 Jul 2004): Fixes and Public Readiness

  21 Jun 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Included
  ferringb's logic fix for the repoman code. Fix that prevents vardb from
  using all files and directories in the vardb as keys instead of only the
  proper ones. Code touchups.

  21 Jun 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> prepstrip: Fixes that
  result in BSD compat and split the regex -- find doesn't do extended.

  21 Jun 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: included a uname
  fix for bsd. Added --fetch-all-uri as a way to get all URIs downloaded for
  a package regardless of conditionals.

  21 Jun 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Moved the
  declaration of ebuild_phase toward the top.

  09 Jul 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/emerge:
  Fixed incorrect assignment of depgraph.mydbapi[] objects.

  07 Jul 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/repoman:
  Solved a big memory problem in repoman where a full scan required several
  gigabytes, caused by apparently unused objects.

  04 Jul 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/emerge pym/portage.py:
  Fixed issue that allowed installed virtuals to overide user virtuals.

  03 Jul 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/emerge: Added masked
  package removal to binpkg candidates before getting the best. (#55871)

  01 Jul 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py:
  Fixed exception catching on module import.

  27 Jun 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/repoman:
  Fixed year (2003 -> 2004) in copyright lines.

  27 Jun 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py:
  Added a check for symlinked dirs to the collision-protect code so it doesn't
  double-check files in symlinked dirs with wrong pathnames.

  26 Jun 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> bin/regenworld: Fixed 
  regenworld. It always failed without -h or --help.

  26 Jun 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> bin/emerge: Added more
  messages when emerge fails due to masked package.

  26 Jun 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> portage.py:
  Added pkgsplit check on values returned by vardbapi.cpv_all()

  26 Jun 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> repoman: Removed a stray dot.

  25 Jun 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> repoman: Changed CVS
  header regex to "Gentoo Foundation"

*portage-2.0.51_pre12 (21 Jun 2003): Fixes

  21 Jun 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Removed the
  extra spawn of portageq as sandbox handles the python pyo's accesses now.

  21 Jun 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixes for
  the HOME issues. Correction of permissions from 6770 to 2770.

  21 Jun 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py:
  Fixed problem that 'emerge something' would install all depeneded pkgs 
  even if they are already installed.
  
*portage-2.0.51_pre11 (21 Jun 2004): Fixes

  21 Jun 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Disabled the
  URL encoding for BINHOST as it will take a lot of work to get it right.
  Execve try/except added to handle missing binaries and such. Changed the
  default HOME to be TMPDIR/homedir. Try/except on db close operations. Add
  in missing unlocks. Hacked in the /var/lib/portage in a chroot fix.

  21 Jun 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Added more info
  into the profile for the stacked profiles.

  21 Jun 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: The userland
  fixes for *BSD. QA Notice fix for IUSE verbosity on global scope stuff.
  Missing quote fix for QA intercepters. Return 0 in the use_* functions.
  Removed AA from the readonly list.

  21 Jun 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> dohtml: Karl's update
  which is mostly a rewrite.

  21 Jun 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> bin/emerge:
  Modified emerge to build up a fakedb regardless of 'empty' in params, 
  and to incrementally add any packages added to the dep graph.
  (#1343, #8810, #54608)

  20 Jun 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> bin/repoman:
  Fixed problem which fails to detect IUSE value. (#21544)

  20 Jun 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> bin/emerge:
  Added an exception code for broken timestamp.chk. (#54380)

  20 Jun 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> pym/ebuild.sh: Adjusted 
  returns for use_with and use_enable to only return 1 on invalid usage.

  20 Jun 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py:
  Fixed problems that portage doesn't block with --update option(#52377)
  and fail to block virual packages(#52506).

  20 Jun 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py:
  Fixed CONFIG_PROTECT/CONFIG_PROTECT_MASK in /etc/csv.env(#51646).

  20 Jun 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild.sh:
  Added error message when pkg_config is not defined. (#51167)

  14 Jun 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py:
  Fixed bug in portdbapi.aux_get where a problem ebuild would cause a lock
  to not be released.

  09 Jun 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/emerge:
  Changed emerge --info to reflect libc versions other than glibc.  

  08 Jun 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py:
  Added the collision-protect feature that prevents packages from
  overwriting files they don't own. Has to be enabled with 
  FEATURES=collision-protect  as it needs more testing before it 
  can be enabled by default (bug #28228).

  05 Jun 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild.sh:
  Fix rpm support by changing rpm to rpmbuild (bug #13508).

  05 Jun 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/regenworld:
  Added a --help message ro regenworld (bug #37539).

  03 Jun 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed bug #52720
  and restored patch for a 35% drop in dep calc time.

*portage-2.0.51_pre10 (02 Jun 2003): Fixes

  02 Jun 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Added MANPATH
  to the colon_seperated list -- parsing code NEEDS TO BE FIXED. * and ~*
  matches allowed for package.use for arch-development -- ~* implies *.

  02 Jun 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Fix for a new
  typo in the logger function that prevented emerge.log from being written.

  02 Jun 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: make test
  only occurs when enabled in FEATURES and not in RESTRICT -- defaults OFF.
  Added ferringb's local B_* fix for eclasses. Made db vars readonly via bash
  for non-depend phases after the global scope.
  
  02 Jun 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py: Reverted
  adjusted made to config.setcpv on 18 May 2004 due to bug #52720.

  01 Jun 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/repoman,bin/regenworld:
  only messages about broken log entries in regenworld when called with
  --debug. Fix signing stuff in repoman.

*portage-2.0.51_pre9 (22 May 2003): Speedups and bug fixes

  22 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_db_template.py:
  Added in last-three caching for db modules. Ensuring that keys are strings.

  22 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_db_cpickle.py: Fix
  that ensures the Unpickler works properly.

  22 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Updates for
  environment files ordering in ebuild.sh. Added in normalize_path to handle
  the really annoying "'//' is a legal prefix" issue with os.path.normpath.
  Applied normalize_path to cacheddir() so that the keys match and we have
  more cache hits and better performance. Added statistics to to cacheddir
  available with noise=2. Do not return a blocker when doing a zerolist.
  Fixed the stacking functions to properly order the incrementals and apply
  the removals forward. Changed all string.atoi() to int(). Added in the
  selinux changes for spawning the fetch command. Added a patch that allows
  ebuild.sh to display 'validcommands'. close_caches() added to allow atexit
  to close all the DB connections. close_portdbapi_cache() handles the global
  that has all db instances -- This avoids problems with the API nulling the
  internal links. Adjusted the db handling for sync() calls and removed some
  object duplication db calls.

  22 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> getbinpkg.py: Fix for HTTP
  redirects (301 and 302) so that the redirect opens a new connection to the
  move-location server -- This allows us to redirect to a different machine.

  22 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: For iuse output we
  now ensure that the correct db is referenced. The worldfile additions do not
  occur when a packages is new and updates are not being performed. Patch to
  add binutils to the emerge info.

  22 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Rearranged the
  sourcing of the profiles and the special environment files. Added src_test
  as an optional test method -- Some packages are extremely dumb and need to
  be prevented from using this via RESTRICT.

  18 May 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> portage.py: Minor speed
  improvement in config.setcpv preventing a useless regenerate

  18 May 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> portage.py: Reversed the
  order of config.getvirtuals' stack_dictlist call for correct ordering.

*portage-2.0.51_pre8 (16 May 2003): Big cleanups & Ebuild QA Stuff.

  16 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_exception.py: New
  file containing portage exceptions. Added 'CorruptionError' for the db code.

  16 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_util.py: New file
  that contains utility functions. Allows db_modules to use portage functions
  without a circular dependency. CODE IS DUPLICATED and needs to be fixed in
  portage.py to use this new module. grab*, getconfig, varexpand, pickle_*,
  ReadOnlyConfig

  16 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_db_*: Modules
  do not have an __init__ any longer -- module_init() is called by the
  template after loading the config and setting the 5 variables inside of
  the class. self.config is a ReadOnlyConfig object which is just a dict
  that you can't write to. Throws CorruptionError when the read functions
  return exceptions. 

  16 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Reversed the
  virtuals order so it matches the documented format. When an ebuild does not
  exist, we now raise a KeyError with a useful string. 'couple minutes' changed
  to 'couple of minutes' for Seemant. ;)

  16 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> prepstrip, ebuild.5,
  repoman.1: Typo corrections/text replacements.

  16 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Added deprecation
  notice to 'emerge rsync' to favor 'emerge sync'. Modified the emerge.log
  code to not change permissions on the files beyond what is necessary -- NEEDS
  TO BECOME AN ADDITIVE FUNCTION. Produce a warning instead of a traceback
  when an ebuild does not exist for -U.

  16 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Touched up the
  logging stuff at the top. Removed extra_functions.sh. src_compile additions
  so that it can run make without having a config file requirement.

  16 May 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> dobin,dosbin: Removed the
  duplicated stripping from the helper tools.

  09 May 2004; Jason Stubbs <jstubbs@gentoo.org> pym/portage_dep.py:
  fixed bug in use_reduce that caused returned list to be flattened.

  30 Apr 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/ebuild.sh:
  modified ebuild.sh error message on seemants and roger55s request.

*portage-2.0.51_pre7 (26 Apr 2003): Big cleanups & Ebuild QA Stuff.

  25 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed masking
  problems due to the new stacking functions and empty-value stripping.

*portage-2.0.51_pre6 (25 Apr 2003): Big cleanups & Ebuild QA Stuff.

  25 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Dropped selinux
  from the IUSE complainer list.

  25 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> repoman: Made it use the
  constants defined in portage.py for the world file.
  
  25 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Modifications
  so that the virtuals are incremented in the proper order and reversed the
  final values so that the first virtual is the 'best' one. Try to put the
  INHERITED variable back into the environment before calling out to portage.
  This makes the ECLASS QA notices actually valid.

*portage-2.0.51_pre5 (25 Apr 2003): Big cleanups & Ebuild QA Stuff.

  25 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed name
  of the world file constant. Fixed the virtuals loading and vartree creation
  circular dep with a repitition hack. Fixed the virtuals loading function so
  that it doesn't destroy the virtuals before saving them.

  25 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed all the
  references to the world file to use portage constants. Made the verbose
  output for use flags call unique array to make sure values aren't duped.

  25 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Typo fix for
  inherited, and removed the delay.

*portage-2.0.51_pre4 (25 Apr 2003): Big cleanups & Ebuild QA Stuff.

  25 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Creation of
  a great number of 'constants' that were hard coded in various places and
  now are created in a cascaded style, for the most part. Exception handling
  for the loading of modules added along with verbose messages about the
  exception being handled for user info. PRIVATE_PATH is a new constant that
  points to the new directory we will be using for portage internal data --
  It is a secure directory that only group portage may write, read, and scan.
  PORTAGE_CACHEDIR is deprecated -- The real cache directory is FHS and is a
  constant -- The dep cache is named specifically now as 'PORTAGE_DEPCACHEDIR'.
  
  **Changed the stacking functions** so they are quite a bit more sane -- They
  still need a little help though -- stack_* functions are now used to stack
  specific types instead of using grab_stacked "super functions" -- The naming
  is a little rough but intelligable.
  
  **VIRTUALS modification** The /var/cache/edb/virtuals file is unnecessary
  as portage now loads the provides from the vartree itself. /etc/portage
  may have a virtuals file that stacks on top of the var and profile virtuals.
  This also entails the removal of the virtual-file handling code (yay!).

  25 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Fix for the name
  change for PORTAGE_CACHEDIR to PORTAGE_DEPCACHEDIR.

  25 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Added checks
  to ensure that use flags are properly mentioned in IUSE. Adjusted the QA
  Interceptors (function overrides for common app names) to make sure they
  don't interfere in weird cases -- Relying on 'type -p' now. Eclasses are
  checked for illegal inheritance modes (conditional-based). Increased the
  cache lines for an entry -- Added 'PROVIDE' and 8 empties.

  22 Apr 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> bin/repoman:
  added a CVS Header check to repoman

  20 Apr 2004; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> pym/portage.py:
  fix for getmaskingreason if the mask isn't in PORTDIR's package.mask (#48447)

  17 Apr 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> repoman: Fixed for
  python-2.2 compatibility.

*portage-2.0.51_pre3 (13 Apr 2003): Cleanups and small features.

  13 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_db_*: Fixed the
  permissions issues regarding the umask problems with DB vars.

  13 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fix for the
  import urllib call that was misspelled for PORTAGE_BINHOST. Genone's patch
  that allows FETCHCOMMAND_${PROTOCOL}. getmaskingreadon() from genone's
  package.mask display patch.

  13 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> output.py: For some reason
  people have a problem with my bad spelling of semi-common colors, so I added
  in requested changes for the color 'fuchsia'.

  13 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> cnf/make.conf: Comment
  fixes for the CHOST line. FEATURES modification.

  13 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> dispatch-conf.conf: Removed
  the 'a' option.

  13 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Catagory searches
  added if search is prefixed with '@'. jstubbs/spider's fix for binary use
  flag passing problems worked in. Genone's patch for package.mask comment
  display. Patch to display warnings when unmerging system packages worked in.

  13 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Quieted up
  some output for use/has internally. Added a patch for the help output.
  Added functionality to pass down IUSE from eclasses. Made several variables

  11 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Portage can now
  match categories if the search is prefixed with an '@' -- @app-portage will
  list all packages in app-portage... '@portage' will match all in app-portage
  and will match anything with portage in the title -- It's still a regex.

  11 Apr 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: nostrip in
  RESTRICT now enables DEBUGBUILD -- stripping and related functionality
  needs to get cleaned up better.

  favor of the new code in portage_dep paren_reduce and use_reduce. dep_zapdeps
  got an overhaul for much more intelligent selection of packages and virtual
  handling during depgraph generation. Binary tree enhancements and selection
  enhancements. bindbapi created to do aux_get on binaries. isInjected added
  to vardbapi to get injected status. SRC_URI uses the new portage_dep code
  to handle strings now -- nesting should would flawlessly and FEATURES=cvs

  20 Mar 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_db_cpickle.py:
  Added pickle loading safety.

  20 Mar 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_dep: Temp home

  Fixed some repoman/portage bugs. repoman shouldn't use /etc/portage/*
  files. repoman shouldn't use PORTDIR_OVERLAY(#11335). repoman should use
  each arch profile dir(#43601). portage didn't handle virtual dependency
  with version (>=virtual/package-1.0) in some places.

*portage-2.0.50 (06 Feb 2003): Release -- API change, cleanups, speedups

  06 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> *: repoman got a quick fix
  from genone. Ed's fix for ask/pretend. Made sure that emerge force-updated
  the eclass cache before trying to update all the metadata. masking type
  patch from Genone. masking info patch and regenworld patch added.

*portage-2.0.50_pre22 (04 Feb 2003): Cleanups and stablizing

  04 Feb 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: TGL's fixes
  for exec/child/wait problems. Unset GREP_OPTIONS GREP_COLOR. has() and use()
  no longer attempt to determine if they are to be quiet or noisy -- They
  default to noisy -- useq() and hasq() are the non-verbose versions.
  EBUILD_PHASE set to add a hack-ish way around global scope calls in
  eclasses -- NOTHING SHOULD BE CALLED IN THE GLOBAL SCOPE. Touchup to the
  inherit() code that should finally allow the removal of the ECLASS and
  INHERITED settings. Removed tty (use/has) calls. Removed dirname calls --
  portage.py handles setting the dbkey filename now.
  
  04 Feb 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Ed Catmur's
  (with a  little TGL added in) patch for --ask. Added a 'metadata' target
  that skips the sync and only updates the cache. FEATURES="getbinpkg" added.
  TGL's exit code fixes. Fixed match code for -S so it doesn't complain about
  specific and double versions. Unmerge via dbpath fix. Rewrote rsync's
  options that supports --verbose and --quiet operation now and can force
  checksumming all files using --debug. Sort the files in the cache update
  so it's a little more predictable. 

  04 Feb 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> prepstrip: changed 
  --strip-debug to --strip-unneeded.

  04 Feb 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> getbinpkg.py: Updates to
  enable HTTP/HTTPS authentication.

  04 Feb 04; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: best_from_dict
  added to grab the best entry from set of dicts using a list of the keys for
  priority. jstubb's patch to fix listdir -- splits it into a cache and list
  setup. jstubb's patch for varexpand to handle $VAR better. Latexer's patch
  for KernelVersion code to use Makefiles instead of the version.h. Modules
  are loaded from /etc/portage/modules or defaults, whichever works. Fixed
  the /etc/make.profile-is-missing traceback. Spawn can be given 3 pipes to
  redirect stdin,stdout,stderr to specific outputs, terminals, or files.
  TGL's patch for cache functions in portage.py so that they do not cache at
  inappropriate times. PORTAGE_TMPFS is now used if set as a temporary file
  operation area -- recommended to actually be a ramfs/tmpfs filesystem for
  speed. Genone enhanced the deprecated profile patch.

  31 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed --skipfirst
  bug. This closes #36880.

  29 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: TGL's patch
  for imporving overlay verbose. This closes #39765.

  27 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed
  autouse bug. autouse were ignored.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Output failed
  cache updates during emerge sync.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> *: VDB_PATH fixes.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Only use
  custom profiles when not called by repoman. ROOT never changes profile
  roots, only custom/system profiles var/cache/edb/virtuals. Sandbox fix
  where sandbox was creating an invalid logfile (not giving a summary)
  due to a '/' in SANDBOX_LOG. Turned down the Lockfile output. Double
  check the INCOMPLETE MERGE identifications as it can be caused by cache.

  24 Jan 2004; <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: Improved timestamp check 
  when 'emerge sync'. Added catching amiguous error when unmerge.
  This closes #24325.

  23 Jan 2004; <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge, portage.py: Fixed 2 bugs. 
  Portage doesn't read local virtuals file, which happens on only cvs
  version. package is blocked by itself.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py, emerge:
  Fix from genone for emerge's direct reading of packages and his patch
  that also adds in /etc/portage/profile as a stacked profile.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Completed
  inheritence capabilities for portage.config reading some files. Moved a
  copy of the getvirtuals() function into settings to handle multiple
  profiles properly.

*portage-2.0.50_pre17/18/19 (21 Jan 2004): Modules for DBs and quick fixes

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> *: Moved all references
  to var/db/pkg to portage.VDB_PATH --- This will change again -- NEED TO
  BE MOVED INTO A PATH/CONSTANTS SETUP.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> dosed: Quick fix for
  the basename missing/misplaced issue.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Added
  /dev/console to PREDICT to attempt a workaround for a serial console
  bug. dbkey is now set through portage.py/doebuild to allow for modular
  db code.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: regen doesn't
  require root anymore. Edited the timestamp check to be a little more
  friendly -- delete the portdir timestamp and it won't use the alternate.
  Fix some permission settings. Added some warnings in for cachedirs that
  are very likely to ruin your system. Cleaned out some of the eclass code
  that isnt valid any longer.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portageq: Added vdb_path
  as a target to get the db directory. Quickpkg uses this.

  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Added
  load_mod() -- grabs a class/function from a module and passes it back
  without loading the module into the global scope. Added unique_array()
  which eliminates duplicates from an array. grab_stacked() operates like
  the other grab* and getconfig functions, but takes a filename and a set
  of paths that it will apply incrementally or clobbers -- for profile
  inheritance. getconfig no longer exits on non-existance returns None.
  Class config now should be passed a profile path and a set of incremental
  values instead of using the globals -- defaults to using the globals
  presently and print an error message. Adding support for module configs
  as a set of strings 'class.subclass.objectmodule':'module.to.use.object'
  for load_mod and the database modules. Profile inheritance started. Killed
  the eclass() super-function and replaced it with class eclass_cache that
  is visible and conceptually simpler -- Also uses the plugable modules.
  Cleaned out the sync calls for the DBs. MASSIVE simplification of the
  aux_get code -- removed memory-caching in favor of system cache (actually
  faster in all cases so far -- P100 and P4-2.2G). Lockfile usage around the
  cachefile.
  
  21 Jan 2004; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage_db_*: Updated
  the API a little but to have permissions set properly. A little more
  reorganization and removed the keycount checks.

  21 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: download size 
  should not be displayed when the package is nomerge with --tree.

  20 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py: Reverted
  ambiguity package fix in cpv_expand().

  message without --debug. This should close #23840.

  19 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: Improved
  timestamp check of rsync. This should close #37403.

  19 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py: Improved
  regeneration ld.so.cache. This should close #37858.

  19 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed bug which
  emerge doesn't block same package but different version.
  (example: DEPEND="!<cat/pkg-1.0.0" in cat/pkg-1.0.0.ebuild)

  19 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py:
  Modified cpv_expand() to check package.mask. This should close #38592.

  19 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py: Escaped
  regualar expression for replace entry in fixdbentries().

  18 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py:
  Fixed AUTOCLEAN delay problem in .50pre* by TGL's patch. This close 
  #38189. Fixed unmerge failture bug when 'ebuild foo-1.0.0 unmerge'.
  These close #38189, #38366

  18 Jan 2004; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge, portage.py:
  Fixed "ebuild /foo/bar-1.0.0.ebuild unmerge" and "emerge bar-1.0.0 unmerge" 
  problems. This should close #38420.

  "!<=" style block problem. Fixed symlink with absolute path 
  problem in treewalk().

  class to have class lockfiles for the db and tmpdb dirs as well as lock
  other files before editing. Reorganization of the merge code in dblink
  so that the tmpdb is filled immediately after preinst and prior to the
  actual FS merging -- COUNTER and CONTENTS go directly into the tmpdb
  and not into the infodir.

  flat file interface working. See the test for operations.

  15 Dec 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Added a call
  to portageq that causes python to create optimized modules prior to it
  ending up inside the sandbox. Added more output and logging to sync.
  
  15 Dec 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> prepstrip: 'tree' is not
  the same as 'true'.
  
  15 Dec 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: invalid

  settings in unmerge and dblink. Fixed an issue regarding unlinking lockfiles
  while inside of a sandbox.
  
  09 Dec 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh, *.sh:
  Moved helper scripts into bin/functions and made them sourceable -- they
  now will die in cases where sub-parts fail. dodoc and keepdir are now
  recursive-capable.

  09 Dec 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: emerge.log now
  set as portage:portage with 0660 perms. --debug now enables tracebacks
  for dep generation instead of moving code out of the try block.
  
  09 Dec 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> g-cpan.pl: rac's patch
  to get arch list from portage's list of arches in the profiles.
  
  09 Dec 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> repoman: Moved a bit of
  the existing gpg code around -- it might work as is, but requires 'sign'
  in features. Fixed a potential for repoman to miss updates that should
  get a new manifest and commit. Fixed digest/manifest generation for
  non-packagedir runs of repoman.
  
  09 Dec 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emergehelp.py, make.conf,
  getbinpkg.py:  Message touch ups.
  
  09 Dec 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: load_infodir()

  pkg-keywords from genone included. Genone's deprecated profile patch for
  reporting to a user that their current profile is deprecated. Message about
  missing arch.list instead of spouting invalid keywords messages.

  08 Dec 2003; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> repoman:
  Added all arch dependency check. This closes bug #24160.

  07 Dec 2003; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge,portage.py:
  Fixed bugs. 1.--debug doesn't work 2.Portage breaks files
  in /var/db/*/*. 3.No stop if dependency problem happens.
  They are only cvs version problems.

  01 Dec 2003; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed bug which 
  always remakes info dir file.

  29 Nov 2003; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed issue with

  lacking the "setting" argument for pkgmerge()

  29 Nov 2003; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> emerge: fixed rsync bug.
  This closes bug #34660.

  28 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Migration
  to non-global settings started -- class config has new functionality and
  is locked after portage is finished initializing -- changes cannot be made
  to the global instance of config 'settings' -- reset() is now functional,
  setcpv() loads PKGUSE from /etc/portage/package.use, load_infodir() loads
  all small files (under 4k) from the vardb directory of an installed package
  so that operations have the same post* settings as they had at merge time.
  Begin modifications to spawn() to allow for files/pipes to be used for
  IO instead of using getstatusoutput which does not take an environment
  parameter like execve(). check_config_instance() ensures that the provided
  parameter is a 'class config' instance -- for ensuring that everything is
  being passed properly with the changes. Fix for the local FS mirror issue
  where it removed the first '/' instead of the last one. doebuild() cleanups
  for readability and pkguse enhancements -- also remove getstatusoutput()
  usage for depend so that we don't have to modify the active environment.
  Fix for symlink mtime values returned from movefile. (Nakano) SLOTMOVE
  added to global update functionality to fix some issues where a package
  suddenly must become slotted. portdbapi takes a root parameter instead
  of using settings. Slightly more useful output from depend. binarytree()
  now takes a pkgdir instead of using settings. Portage will now die if
  ebuild.sh exits on a signal.
  
  Moved some functions around and renamed them for general use -- derived
  from match2 in class portagetree:
  match_to_list() find all atoms in a list that match a given package.
  best_match_to_list() determines the most specific match. Needs work.
  match_from_list() find all packages in a list that match a given atom.

  28 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> emerge: Fixed an issue
  with searchdesc wanting root permissions if run as non-root. Migrated to
  the non-global config class. EMERGE_FROM added for the dyn_preinst patch
  -- Indicates if a merge is occuring from an ebuild or from a binary. Patch
  for rsync timestamp checking from Nakano.
  
  28 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: Save PKGUSE.
  Pebeneto's patch for dyn_preinst and SELinux added as a fix for binary
  and ebuild merges. Added a kill for portage during the depend phase so
  that portage will actually die if you control-C.

  28 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> *: MASSIVE set of changes
  to start using locally defined 'class config' instances. This allows us to
  start working on some parallelism among other things. Created this way:
  mysettings = portage.config(clone=portage.settings)
  
  The Following functions now take a 'config' parameter:
  spawn(), fetch(), digestgen(), digestcheck(), spawnebuild(), doebuild(),
  merge(), dep_opconvert(), dep_check(), dblink.__init__()
  
  package.keywords is now implemented curtasy of genone/max. PKGUSE was
  rewritten for the global config killing and is also included. X11 man
  pages now found and zipped correctly. SYS.PATH fixes for the python
  migration -- issue actually only shows up on 2.2 systems because of how
  compiled modules are used if found regardless of the original source's
  existance.

  28 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> tabcheck.py: An easier
  way to make sure that all the python stuff is correctly using tabs and
  not mixing spaces.

  28 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> xpak, xpak.py: Fixes
  to ensure that it works if the current dir is missing and that the python
  path gets set properly.
  
  22 Nov 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: Fixed
  calls in vartree method to invalidentry().... made them call call
  self.dbapi.invalidentry() (there were multiple wrong method calls.)
  
  10 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> md5check.py: Checks all
  digests and SRC_URIs for filenames and associated MD5s. Reports collisions
  between versions/packages, missing, and extra lines in digests.

*portage-2.0.49-r17/18 (10 Nov 2003): Fixes

  10 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> *: Changed portage to
  be the first path in sys.path for all python scripts. Also enabled
  optimizations from the scripts to ensure everything imported is built
  for speed. ebuild: applied fix for the '//' root breaking the db[].
  prepstrip: etdyn quickfix
  
  10 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: fix for
  RESTRICT=nouserpriv. GENTOO_MIRRORS can have paths set to take files
  from. Fixes for mishandled cache data regarding *pkgsplit(). Fixes for
  '*' being returned as part of a package split. An 'invalidentry()' fix
  for a traceback. Nakano's fixes for virtual removals not working properly,
  sandbox violations during pkg_nofetch, || depend selection. Genone's
  fixpackages speedup.

  10 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: PORTAGE_TMPDIR
  fix for distcc. Variable passing bug patch for export_functions. Exit 1
  added for nofetch to stop sandbox violation. Nakano's --tree patch added.
  Improved the unmerge messages to denote what kind of unmerge fails. Info
  pages regex pattern adjusted to allow most any name for a page.

  10 Nov 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> repoman: genone's xml
  linting additions.

  01 Nov 2003; Robin H. Johnson <robbat2@gentoo.org> pym/cvstree.py:
  fix bug #32071, by properly escaping a string to not be a regex. Checked
  thru entire *.py tree and found this is the only mis-use of strings that
  need to be escaped.

  31 Oct 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: /lib/modules
  now gets "unmerge protection." This is half of the config protection
  functionality. It means that anything in /lib/modules will not be deleted
  when a package is unmerged (often automatically when a user merges a
  kernel module ebuild for a new kernel.) This solves the "my module
  disappeared!" issue. This closes bug #1477.
  
  31 Oct 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> emerge: Should no longer
  spit out wacky "!!! no match found" warnings when auto-cleaning.
  
  30 Oct 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: Only run
  depscan.sh if it exists on disk. This allows Portage to run inside a stage1
  where /sbin/depscan.sh doesn't exist.
  
  30 Oct 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> portage.py: Applied fix to
  allow multi-level "use? (   )" in SRC_URI, closing bug #16159.

*portage-2.0.49-r15/16 (21 Oct 2003): Fixes

  21 Oct 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> fix-db.py: was broken
  for python2.3 -- fixed now.
  
  21 Oct 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> portage.py: Added
  lockfiles to prelink md5 checks. Fixed caching bug where cache objects
  were passed back as pointers instead of copies. Added 'invalidentry'
  function to handle lockfiles -- It tests/deletes them using unlockfile.
  Added fix-db.py to the 'databases is broken' messages.

  21 Oct 2003; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> ebuild.sh: added CDPATH
  to unset. SELinux fix for sandbox.
