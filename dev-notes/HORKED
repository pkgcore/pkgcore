list what's horked, note your name by it if you want dibs.
This will be updated as things progress; if in doubt/questions about a section, look at the intro doc, 
and ask in #gentoo-portage on freenode, or email the portage ml.
Right now, majority of discussion/questions are via irc, although ml will be used a bit more heavily as things start to 
flesh out (need to get a solid kernel/core)


**important**
portage.package.cpv.ver_cmp fails on this;
dev-lang/icc-7.1.029 > dev-lang/icc-7.1.006 # thinks .006 is gt .029

fetchables aren't implemented.
hack in place but it should be done properly.
portage.ebuild.package will need modification as will portage.ebuild.buildable once fetchable is in.


[namespace fixes required, plus potentially a bit of rewrite]
:portage.sync:
:portage.transports:
transports needs to be unified behind fetcher design.
need a fetchable class also.


[sort of started, some code avail. at least.]

:portage.vdb.*:
Initial code for at least querying the repo is implemented, but nothing further.  Need a package type created for it.
Where it gets a bit hairy (and consult jason/harring if you want to try this portion) is that it is a *modifiable* repo,
packages *do* get added to it.  as such, it will need to generate a mergeoperation, something not defined.

Should be designed such that the underlying disk layout is easily changable, since a global contents db for it *will* be
added (thus removing the reliance on mtime + md5 for discerning whether to remove a file).


:portage.binpkg:
bind it to portage.ebuild where ever possible; akin to portage.vdb.*, initial code was scratched out, but no package 
instance defined for it; which would be wise/useful.
Keep an eye on the design of it so that remote binpkg (BINHOST) can be easily derived from it.


[not started]

:portage.config.domain:
consult intro doc if you attempt it, and collect feedback from jason/brian regarding it please
harring will want it one way which probably slightly conflicts with what jason wants (and vice versa),
so be aware it's probably going to be a shifting class definition.
still need a prototype though.


:portage.*.fetchable:
find a place for this.  simple one however, see intro doc.


:portage.*.(merge|build)operation:
no base class defined yet, see intro.
Not so simple. :)


:emerge:
the UI code (display, etc) can probably be held onto but will need to be refactored to work with the new code.

:repoman:
same thing.  might be able to just update it, but a full rewrite (with modular checks) is a *good* thing.
Man how it's raining out...

:quickpkg:
Yanked it.  Implementation sucks, and it ought to be handled automatically by internal pkg transfers (grabbing a 
package from the vdb, and adding it to binpkg resulting in creation of a binpkg)
