So... got this thing, how do I develop it, how do I get it setup so I can actually work on this framework?
PYTHONPATH is your friend, first of all.  Set it to the directory you place the portage directory in.
So... gentoo-src/portage/portage <-- rewrite lives here, I place the portage directory in 
/home/bharring/new/portage
then export PYTHONPATH="/home/bharring/new/"


Second, you're likely developing this in your home dir (I know I am).  everything hinges on PORTAGE_BASE_PATH

if a portage_custom_path module exists, it is loaded.  it is the hook for defining your own constants-
PORTAGE_BIN_PATH can be defined
DEFAULT_CONF_FILE can be defined (this is the new config, the example config in this directory)
CONF_DEFAULTS is the meta configuration definition, conf_default_types

these settings all default to PORTAGE_BASE_PATH ; if you define it in portage_custom_path, the settings above will be based off of it.
if no portage_custom_path, then it defaults to "/home/bharring/new/" which probably isn't what you want.

So, how to set this sucker up?
copy ../portage somewhere, copy ../bin somewhere , copy this directory somewhere.
add a portage_custom_path.py to either /usr/lib/portage/pym/ , or /usr/lib/python-*/site-pkgs/ with paths defined to proper locations.
from there, you'll need to mangle a config (in this directory).  If you have the usual defaults for a gentoo system, you won't have
to modify it aside from cflags tweaking, etc.

so... after you've done this, try this- need to register the ebuild plugin, running as root-
/path/to/checkout/bin/utilities/register_plugin.py -s format ebuild_src 0.0 portage.ebuild.ebuild_package.generate_new_factory

You'll need to have PYTHONPATH set as root, note that sudo cleanses the env normally.
If that fails, you're PYTHONPATH is invalid; otherwise it'll spit back a registering message.  So far, good to go.

Drop back to normal user, and try

>>> import portage.config
>>> conf=portage.config.load_config()
>>> tree=conf.repo["rsync repo"]
>>> pkg=tree["dev-util/diffball-0.6.5"]
>>> print pkg.depends
>=dev-libs/openssl-0.9.6j >=sys-libs/zlib-1.1.4 >=app-arch/bzip2-1.0.2


If you've changed your tree name (my tree name is "rsync repo"), you'll have to change what you try above.
if load_config() bails, then you have your paths wrong.  if you see an error msg upon the initial import stating you're going to get 
/home/bharring/new/ , you've defined portage_custom_path.py incorrectly, or it can't be read/found in a python directory; or, you've 
defined the vars wrong, look at portage/const.py and grok what's going on.

If it fails in the pkg instantiation, either your tree is incomplete (no tree at defined path in config), or that version of diffball 
no longer exists.
Anything else, track down ferringb in #gentoo-portage on freenode, or email ferringb (at) gentoo.org , with the traceback, and I'll get 
ya going.

Finally, you need filter-env for ebd.
cd src/filter-env
make filter-env
cp filter-env ../../bin/ebuild-env/

Beyond that, you'll probably want to override path defaults; an example of this is in
http://dev.gentoo.org/~ferringb/config
as is an example of portage_custom_path.py
http://dev.gentoo.org/~ferringb/portage_custom_path.py

The required path override, and portage_custom_path override will be overriden once this beast is autotooled, and will have those 
settings defined upon installation; in the meantime, this is the route since the source isn't autotooled (nor ready to be)
