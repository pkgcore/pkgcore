plugins handling/layout

First, usual statement that it's a work in progress, code is the true authority, not a doc dumped by a dev while he 
was collecting his thoughts ;)

plugins_dir = /var/lib/portage/plugins , tentatively.

installation of a plugin that wants/needs to make it's capabilities known globally, must call pkgcore.plugins.register
prototype of register is

def register(plugin_type, magic, version, namespace, replace=False)

plugin_type is not restricted; it's effectively a categorization of the plugin.  Looking in the plugins module, either the types
will be constants, or listed there (this needs to be nailed down as we progress, dependant on requirements)

magic is just as it sounds, the magic identifier for that plugin.  Needs to be constant.

Version is a fun one.  It's intention is for upgrading of a plugin, the plugin code doesn't use it, it's a way for during
upgrading/removal of plugins, to see if something else has stepped up and now is in charge of that 'magic'.
The plugin handling code doesn't know, nor care, about version, it merely stores it to make plugin (de|)registering easier
for pluging code.

namespace is the pythonic namespace lookup; this is where the instantiating func for that plugin must exist.
fex, say I had a plugin for an move within an fs;
register("os", "selinux_move", "selinux.movefile")

Note there is no enforcement on args; plugin writers will have to handle that themselves to some degree.

The intentions of this specific plugin system are strictly for objects/plugins that must be instanted but do not know, nor should
it know of the code (seperation).
An example, and main reason for this codes inclussion, is format registration.
Via this, the installed package database can be unbundled from knowing each where in python namespace each installed package's 
merge operation/package class code is, it just queries a global registry, which spits back the namespace lookup.

replace is as it sounds, are we willing to replace or not.

Nuking a plugin's global registration is similar.
def deregister(plugin_type, magic, version)

Version is included for the reasons listed above regarding its existance.
It is _strongly_ suggested people use common sense for version, replacement code should bump version for each update.

def query_plugins(plugin_type=None)
	returns a dict of {type:{magic:[namespace, version, *additionals]}
	if type is specified, limit to just that key.
	
def get_plugin(plugin_type, magic)
	returns the namespace lookup for that plugin_type:magic combination.
	else, throws an exception
