kindly check over HORKED; stuff here is "would be nice", but horked comes first.

:binpkg repository: *
Just manual work- fix up pkgcore.binpkg to generate ebuild_built instances (akin to what pkgcore.vdb.ondisk does)

:modify repository.prototype.tree.match to take an optional comparison: *
reasoning being that if we're just going to do a max, pass in the max so it has the option of doing the initial
sorting without passing through visibility filters (which will trigger metadata lookups)


:p.mask visibility handler: *
p.mask comes out to over 300 pkgs, current implementation is a OrRestriction; iow, worst case (the norm I'm afraid), it 
does >300 match runs, in reality probably around >900 (atom == 3 restricts).  This fortunately is easily addressed; basically 
need either 
A) optimizer of RestrictionSets (complex)
B) restrictionSet variation that is able to do containment tests, if matches, then look up remaining restrictions and apply.
B is the easiest, and the one someone should do in the rather near future.  In short, collapse cat/pkg of a pkginst, do a lookup
into a dict, if matched, run the restrictions returned, or return the negation val.
This would knock it down to a dict lookup, then execution of returned remaining restrictions worst case, dict lookup best case.
Bit faster.


:pkgcore.cache.multiplex:
a master/slave cache implementation.  handed master cache (positionally), and secondary caches, this implementation would 
do lookups in master normally, and multiplex the updates/deletetions across all caches handed in.
Sounds odd I realize, but this would be useful so that the master cache generation for rsync could have it's updates slaved 
into a common rdbms w/in gentoo infra, with mirror-dist, src_uri checker, and packages.g.o being able to access it.
Right now they do their own thing, which is inneficient.  This should be pretty easy.


:profiling everything: **
just as it sounds.  profile the whole sucker, and point out areas of where improvement, conversion to cpython might be 
advantageous.  This will be ongoing, initially probably pretty easy, getting harder as low franging fruit picked off.
Why do this? Well, if you think portage is slow, this is how you can help us speed the sucker up.


:pkgcore.config.central features: ***
These may or may not be picked off as development continues; the main requirement for this functionality is 
plugins, which the framework intends... so... prior to a release, it will be added.
1) needs introspection capabilities, looking at a callable to pull further required/section_ref/etc opts out of it.
2) needs method to do lookups of further object restrictions/section_ref/etc from a common dir, based on name.
   this one requires some thought;  essentially, if loading portage-mysql.cache, try 1, or try this opt, look in a dir
   the plugins ebuild can install a section conf tweak, and use it.
3) configuration 'types' , list, bool, str, etc, should be extendable, lifted from a config most likely.  Defaults should be
   avail in code, but should have a method of extending it
4) exec section implementation.  Any section of exec type is automatically executed, able to mangle the central config directly.
   This *is* the hook for having configs stored on a central server, and it's nifty ;)
5) integration of make.globals type data; defaults effectively, but a bit more complex.


:pkgcore.ebuild.gpgtree: ****
derivative of pkgcore.ebuild.ebuild_repository, this overloads ebuild_factory and eclass_cache so that gpg checks are done.
This requires some hackery, partially dependant on config.central changes (see above).
Need a way to specify the trust ring to use, 'severity' level (different class targets works for me).
Anyone who implements this deserves massive cookies.


:pkgcore.ebuild.gpgprofile: ****
Same as above.  Likely need a way to bind the trustring between these too, *or* the gpgprofile lifts it somehow from the gpgtree.
Anyone who implements this deserves massive cookies.


:pkgcore.config.domain:
Redesign, seperation of it into ebuild specific chunk (domain class), and generic abstraction layer.
cleanup needed already, imo :/


:pkgcore.fetch.bundled_lib:
clean this beast up.


:IPV6 handling:
bug 37124 # syncing
check over BINHOST code replacement for any code that resolve to a specific IP

:move pkgcore uid/gid checks out of ebuild.sh, and into python side:


:locking unification.  see plugins for an example of why it's needed


:extend packages.* parsing to support globs in pkg: *
