Note: document in process. please update as this (initially) is just a quick jotting down

This should hold the proposed (with a chance of making it in), and accepted/implemented changes for ebuild format version 1.
bit hard to do, but a version 0 doc (current internal implementation/behaviour) would be good also.

[Version 0 (or undefined eapi, <=portage-2.0.52*)]

[Version 1]
EAPI=1 required, at some point likely assumed but not yet.
src_configure exists, any configuration calls must occur in that phase, not in src_compile
RDEPEND="${RDEPEND-${DEPEND}}" autosetting no longer is done.
addition of elib functionality, which notes the file to source, then sources it post global ebuild sourcing.
(proposed) BDEPEND metadata addition.
default IUSE support, IUSE="+gcj" == USE="gcj" unless the user disables it.
default src_install function

no more blocking on virtuals/metapkg.  See glep37 for the correct solution to this.
test depend, test src_uri
